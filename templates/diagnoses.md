# Caveats
## Extended Evaluation Period
Please be advised, due to circumstances surrounding COVID-19 pandemic, this evaluation was conducted over an extended period of time. Notably, the mental health evaluation, including the KSADS diagnostic interview was administered in MONTH YEAR. Thus, the following results and recommendations reflect {{CHILD_NAME}}'s functioning at that time and are not representative of any changes which may have occurred over the course of his/her participation in the study.
## New Information since MH
PLEASE BE ADVISED: As part of the current evaluation, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s psychiatric functioning was assessed via the K-SADS semi-structured psychiatric interview for DSM-5 on DATE. During a subsequent conversation in DATE, {{PARENT_NAME}} provided an update on recent developments regarding symptoms of suicidality (as mentioned above) for {{CHILD_NAME}}. As such, these symptoms are not included below.
## Validity of Child Questionnaires
### difficulty understanding questions
Lastly, {{CHILD_NAME}} endorsed an extremely high level of anxiety symptoms in self-report questionnaires which was later denied in interviews. It is important to note that due to difficulty with reading, {{CHILD_NAME}} may have misunderstood the written questions, calling into question the validity of his/her responses. {{CHILD_NAME}} further indicated significant problems with attention, learning, hyperactivity and aggression, which were not indicated to be problematic by his/her parent/teacher. Nevertheless, interviews did indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} has residual low self-esteem associated with his/her history of academic struggles. It is crucial that {{CHILD_NAME}} receive appropriate therapeutic support to manage his/her emotional regulation as well as interventions to improve his/her self-efficacy.
### high stress day of evaluation
Of note, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s self-reported questionnaires were completed on a day shortly following a stressful period and thus are not reflective of his/her general functioning. He/She endorsed extremely elevated symptoms across internalizing and externalizing problem domains. However, upon further interviews taking place at later sessions, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s reports regarding his/her mood and anxiety were significantly less severe.
## Abbreviated MH with learning referral concerns/ previous learning/language dx:
### previous Developmental Coordination Disorder diagnosis
The current abbreviated mental health evaluation did not assess cognitive and academic functioning due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s previous diagnosis of Developmental Coordination Disorder is listed below, by history. Follow up evaluations should monitor his/her functioning and he/she should continue to receive support in this domain.
### language delays and learning concerns
The current abbreviated mental health evaluation did not assess cognitive and academic functioning due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s history of language delays and intervention and concerns regarding reading, writing and math indicate a comprehensive evaluation is important. It is anticipated that when the Healthy Brain Network offices re-open, {{CHILD_NAME}} will be scheduled for in-person appointments and complete the standardized cognition, academic, and language measures at that time.
# Diagnoses
## ADHD
### presentations
#### Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined presentation
##### teacher report not available
###### periodic reassessment recommended
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} presents with inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive symptoms that are consistent with a diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined presentation.  {{CHILD_NAME}}'s neurocognitive profile (i.e., weaknesses in sustained attention, working memory, processing speed, executive functioning), elevations on the Conners, CBCL, ESWAN, YSR, and TRF questionnaires, further support this diagnosis. Teacher report was not available. It is not uncommon that children with ADHD exhibit changes in symptomatology over the course of childhood, as they begin to receive support. As such, periodic reassessment of symptom levels is warranted. Psychotherapeutic intervention including psychopharmacology consultation and implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning are suggested, as described below.
###### responded well to structure and individualized support
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} presents with inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive symptoms that are consistent with a diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined presentation. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s testing profile on neurocognitive tests (i.e., difficulty with working memory and attention) similarly indicated strong agreement with an ADHD diagnosis. Teacher reports were not available. Behavioral observations indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} responded very well to structure and individualized support, with above average attention displayed in the one-to -one testing sessions. Psychotherapeutic intervention including psychopharmacology consultation and implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning are suggested, as described below.
##### Initial Dx w/ Sleep Problems
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} presents with inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive symptoms that are consistent with a diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined presentation. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s testing profile on neurocognitive tests (i.e. inconsistent executive functioning) as well as his/her observed behaviors during testing, similarly indicated strong agreement with an ADHD diagnosis. {{PARENT_NAME}} also reported significant concerns regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s sleep. Sleep difficulties are common in children diagnosed with ADHD and can be associated with higher energy levels, which may translate into difficulty settling down at night. Sleep hygiene recommendations are thus provided below. If sleep difficulties persist, consultation with {{CHILD_NAME}}'s pediatrician or sleep specialist is recommended. It is not uncommon that children with ADHD exhibit changes in symptomatology over the course of childhood, as they begin to receive support. As such, periodic reassessment of symptom levels is warranted. Psychotherapeutic intervention including psychopharmacology and implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning are suggested, as described below.
##### Mild Severity
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} continues to exhibit symptoms that are consistent with his/her previous diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined Presentation. {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent both endorsed a wide range of symptoms in K-SADS interview (X inattentive and X hyperactive symptoms). Furthermore, in questionnaires, {{CHILD_NAME}} self-reported a clinically significant level of difficulty in these domains. Alternatively, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parents emphasized that {{CHILD_NAME}} has incorporated very effective compensatory strategies which help him/her regulate and organize his/her many responsibilities. Consequently, although his/her teachers reportedly are concerned regarding his/her attention, clinical levels of symptoms were not indicated on the teacher questionnaire. {{CHILD_NAME}} is very involved in extra-curricular activities which demand a significant amount of his/her time and energy resources. Considering his/her overall high level of adjustment and low level of impairment, a qualifier of 'mild' is appropriate in describing his/her ADHD diagnosis. It is not uncommon that children with ADHD exhibit changes in symptomatology over the course of childhood and adolescence. As such, periodic reassessment of symptom levels is warranted. {{CHILD_NAME}} will benefit from continued implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning as described below.
##### w/ language and learning difficulty
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} presents with inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive symptoms that are consistent with a diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined presentation. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s testing profile on neurocognitive tests (i.e., marked deficits in processing speed and working memory) similarly indicated strong agreement with an ADHD diagnosis. It is important to note that children who have learning and language disorders can present as inattentive, when in fact they are having difficulty concentrating due to difficulty understanding/processing the presented concepts. To the extent that these factors contribute to his/her ADHD symptoms, improvements in attention would be expected with appropriate support in school, with instruction modified to his/her ability level. However, reports and observations indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s difficulty focusing and hyperactivity extends beyond situations in which he/she might not understand what is expected. It is not uncommon that children with ADHD exhibit changes in symptomatology over the course of childhood, as they begin to receive support. As such, periodic reassessment of symptom levels is warranted. Psychotherapeutic intervention including psychopharmacology and implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning are suggested, as described below.
##### Current and Past Symptoms
{{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} completed the K-SADS semi-structured psychiatric interview for DSM-5 as well as several questionnaires related to emotional and behavioral function. These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} continues to meet criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)-Combined Presentation, consistent with his/her reported and documented history. However, it is important to consider current and past symptomology. At this time, {{CHILD_NAME}} and {{PARENT_NAME}} reported X/9 present and X/9 past frequent symptoms of inattention as well as X/9 present and X/9 past frequent symptoms of impulsivity/hyperactivity. Given the past/current treatment and past/current school support {{CHILD_NAME}} has been receiving, full criteria are not met at this time. However, as per his/her documented history of ADHD and consistent with behavioral observations gathered from this evaluation, this diagnosis will be retained. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s neurocognitive profile (i.e., deficits/weaknesses in sustained attention, processing speed, executive functioning, working memory) as well as elevations on the Conners-3, YSR, CBCL, TRF, and ESWAN questionnaires further support this diagnosis. Behavioral strategies and plans may be used in conjunction with medication to help {{CHILD_NAME}} focus on tasks.
#### Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation
##### standard
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)-Predominantly Hyperactive/Impulsive Presentation based on X/9 frequent symptoms of inattention and X/9 frequent symptoms of impulsivity/hyperactivity.'{{CHILD_NAME}}'s neurocognitive profile (i.e., weaknesses in sustained attention, working memory, processing speed, executive functioning), as well as elevations on the Conners, CBCL, ESWAN, YSR, and TRF questionnaires, further support this diagnosis. Psychotherapeutic intervention and implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning is suggested, as described below. A consultation with a psychiatrist is also suggested, as described below, to consider options for psychopharmacological treatment.
##### improved with pharmacological treatment and new school setting
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for a diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder'predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation. Behavioral observations and results from above mentioned computer administered tasks of executive functioning further support this diagnosis. {{PARENT_NAME}} indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity have significantly improved since starting pharmacological treatment and beginning in his/her new school setting. Teacher confirmation of his/her behavior at school would be optimal. Psychotherapeutic intervention and implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning is suggested, as described below. A consultation with a psychiatrist is also suggested, as described below, to consider options for psychopharmacological treatment.
#### Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly inattentive presentation
##### standard
Results indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)-Predominantly Inattentive Presentation based on X/9 frequent symptoms of inattention and X/9 frequent symptoms of impulsivity/hyperactivity. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s neurocognitive profile (i.e., weaknesses in attention, executive functioning, processing speed, and working memory) as well as elevations on the Conners, CBCL, ESWAN, YSR, and TRF further support this diagnosis. Behavioral strategies and plans may be used in conjunction with medication to help {{CHILD_NAME}} focus on tasks.
##### suggested consultation with psychiatrist
These reports indicate that, consistent with his/her previous diagnosis, {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly inattentive presentation, due to the number, frequency and severity of his/her endorsed symptoms. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s neurocognitive profile on objective testing (i.e. weaknesses in processing speed and working memory) further supports this diagnosis. Psychotherapeutic intervention and implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning is suggested, as described below. A consultation with a psychiatrist is also suggested, as described below, to consider options for psychopharmacological treatment.
##### w/ ODD-like Bxes
Based on his/her parent reports, {{PARENT_NAME}} also identified a pattern of defiance, argumentative behavior, and temper or emotional outbursts for {{CHILD_NAME}}. Emotional outbursts are common in children with ADHD. These children often lack an understanding of emotions and the adaptive skills necessary to cope with them, as well as the social communication skills to convey frustration and negative feelings. Emotional outbursts may therefore serve as a child's only means of communicating frustration or negative feelings. Although sometimes intense in nature, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s outbursts are reportedly triggered by events that likely produce frustration and disappointment (e.g., homework, others not following his/her rules). They do not occur in the context of a chronically irritable mood and thus do not clearly suggest the presence of a mood disorder at this time. While these symptoms can be classified as mild oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), they may be better explained by the presence of {{CHILD_NAME}}'s inattentive and hyperactive symptoms. At this time, {{CHILD_NAME}} does not meet for ADHD-Combined Presentation. However, there are some hyperactive behaviors reported by his/her parents and teacher (i.e., restless, difficulty remaining seated) and observed during this evaluation (i.e., fidgeting, interrupting others) that are impairing and ought to be addressed through targeted intervention. As such, intensive cognitive behavioral therapy and parent management training are recommended to address these symptoms and may be helpful in augmenting {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her family's repertoire of adaptive coping strategies that can be applied to psychosocial and family stressors.
##### w/ Subthreshold Hyperactivity
Results indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)-Predominantly Inattentive Presentation based on X/9 frequent symptoms of inattention and X/9 frequent symptoms of impulsivity/hyperactivity. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s neurocognitive profile (i.e., weaknesses in attention, executive functioning, processing speed, and working memory) as well as elevations on the Conners, CBCL, ESWAN, and TRF further support this diagnosis. Though {{CHILD_NAME}} does not meet for ADHD-Combined Presentation based on the current evaluation, there are some hyperactive behaviors reported by {{PARENT_NAME}} (e.g., fidgets, difficulty remaining seated) and observed during this evaluation (e.g., fidgets, got out of chair, talked excessively, interrupted evaluator) that are impairing and ought to be addressed through targeted intervention. Behavioral strategies and plans may be used in conjunction with medication to help {{CHILD_NAME}} focus on tasks.
##### (Girl) w/ subthreshold teacher questionnaire
{{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for a diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)-Predominantly Inattentive Presentation based on X/9 frequent symptoms of inattention and X/9 frequent symptoms of impulsivity/hyperactivity.  {{PARENT_NAME}} reports {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms of ADHD interfere with her functioning in school and at home. Notably, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s teacher(s) did not endorse significant inattention on a questionnaire, however, considering mom's report that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms impede her academic progress, it is possible inattentive symptoms are not as salient in the classroom as externalizing behavior problems (e.g., hyperactivity).  It is important to consider how ADHD symptoms manifest itself differently between males and females, where males are usually identified with ADHD at higher rates due to their overt behaviors (i.e., hyperactivity and impulsivity).  Psychotherapeutic intervention including psychopharmacology and implementation of strategies to improve her executive functioning are suggested, as described below.
##### w/ intellectual difficulty and Anxiety
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} continues to present with inattentive symptoms that are consistent with a diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly inattentive presentation. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s testing profile on neurocognitive tests (i.e. difficulty with processing speed and attention) similarly indicated strong agreement with an ADHD diagnosis. Teacher reports were not available. It is important to note that children who have intellectual weaknesses and anxiety can present as inattentive, when in fact they are having difficulty concentrating due to difficulty understanding/processing the presented concepts as well as emotional dysregulation. To the extent that these factors contribute to his/her ADHD symptoms, improvements in attention would be expected with effective treatment of his/her anxiety as well as appropriate support in school, with instruction modified to his/her ability level. However, reports and observations indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s difficulty focusing have persisted, while anxiety and mood symptoms which have waxed and waned. Continued psychotherapeutic intervention including psychopharmacology and implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning are suggested, as described below.
##### w/ language and academic weaknesses and anxiety
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly inattentive presentation, due to the number, frequency and severity of his/her endorsed symptoms (X out of 9 inattention symptoms and X out of 9 hyperactive symptoms). {{CHILD_NAME}}'s neurocognitive profile on objective testing (i.e. poor performance on several executive functioning tasks) further supports this diagnosis. It is important to note that children with language and academic weaknesses can present as inattentive, when in fact they are having difficulty understanding/processing the presented concepts. However, parental reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s difficulty focusing extends beyond situations in which he/she might not understand what is expected. It is also crucial to recognize the role that anxiety plays in executive functioning, as anxiety is characterized by symptoms of diminished ability to think, psychomotor agitation and poor concentration, similar to symptoms that characterize ADHD. As such, it is likely that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety, at least in part, contributes to the reported ADHD symptoms. To the extent that these factors contribute to his/her ADHD symptoms, improvements in attention would be expected with effective treatment of his/her anxiety as well as appropriate support in school, with instruction modified to his/her ability level. Psychotherapeutic intervention and implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning is suggested, as described below.
#### Other Specified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (With insufficient inattention and hyperactive symptoms)
##### below clinical threshold
###### w/ elevations on CBCL, TRF, Conners, YSR, and ESWAN questionnaires
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for Other Specified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) based on X/9 frequent symptoms of inattention and X/9 frequent symptoms of impulsivity/hyperactivity, historically and currently. Elevations on the CBCL, TRF, Conners, YSR, and ESWAN questionnaires further support this diagnosis. To meet full diagnostic criteria for a research-based diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, an individual must exhibit at least 6 symptoms of inattention and/or 6 symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity. {{PARENT_NAME}} has observed {{CHILD_NAME}}'s inattentive and hyperactive symptoms to be evident and impairing in various settings (i.e., home, school, community). Thus, behavioral strategies and plans and medication may be useful to help {{CHILD_NAME}} focus on tasks and decrease inattentive and impulsive/hyperactive symptoms.
###### standard
{{PARENT_NAME}} indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} displays several symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity, but the range of symptoms, currently fall below the clinical threshold for a diagnosis of ADHD. Although {{CHILD_NAME}} does not meet criteria for a full diagnosis of ADHD, considering the level of impairment caused by the symptoms and his/her neuropsychological profile discussed above (i.e. deficits in executive functioning), a diagnosis of Other Specified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder is warranted. As such, he/she will require support in school to improve his/her executive functioning skills and will benefit from the interventions and strategies listed below.
##### clinically significant self-report
Regarding inattention and hyperactivity, {{PARENT_NAME}} indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} displays several symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity, but the range of symptoms, severity and level of impairment, currently fall below the clinical threshold for a diagnosis of ADHD. Conversely, in interviews with {{CHILD_NAME}}, he/she self-reports that paying attention is the hardest part of school for his/her and further indicated clinically elevated symptomatology. Although {{CHILD_NAME}} does not meet criteria for a full diagnosis of ADHD, considering his/her self-reported impairment and his/her neuropsychological profile discussed above (i.e. deficits in executive functioning), a diagnosis of Other Specified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder is warranted.
##### improved symptoms/no longer clinically significant
Regarding inattention and hyperactivity, their current reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} has made much progress in this domain and no longer displays symptoms at a clinically significant level. This is likely due, in part, to the appropriateness of {{CHILD_NAME}}'s current school setting. Additionally, {{CHILD_NAME}} indicated that his/her motivation in school has increased and he/she employs many compensatory strategies to help him/her complete his/her work in an efficient manner. A teacher report was not available. Considering his/her current low severity of symptoms and high level of functioning, {{CHILD_NAME}} does not currently meet criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD. However, a diagnosis of Other Specified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder is warranted to account for his/her need for continued support in executive functioning. It is not uncommon that children with ADHD exhibit changes in symptomatology over the course of childhood and adolescence. As such, periodic reassessment of symptom levels is warranted.
### Rule-Out Diagnosis
#### w/ language and academic weakness
{{PARENT_NAME}} reported significant symptoms of inattention, however, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s significant language and academic deficits cannot be ruled out as the primary cause of her inattention symptoms. Children with language and academic weaknesses can present as inattentive, when in fact they are having difficulty understanding/processing the presented concepts. To the extent that language delays contribute to his/her inattentive symptoms, improvements in attention would be expected with effective treatment and support geared towards academic and language deficits. If symptoms of inattention persist following implementation of academic supports, or increased impairment is noted, further evaluation may be considered. As such, a rule out  diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly inattentive presentation is indicated below. {{CHILD_NAME}} will nevertheless benefit from implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning as described below.
#### No teacher report/impairment in only one setting
Based on parental reports, {{CHILD_NAME}} displays significant symptoms of inattention in the home setting. However, parent report questionnaires did not indicate clinically elevated symptoms. Furthermore, {{PARENT_NAME}} did not endorse significant impairment from inattention symptoms outside the home setting and teacher reports were not available. Impairment in more than one setting is required to make a diagnosis of ADHD. As such, further evaluation and teacher reports are recommended in order to rule out the diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly inattentive presentation. Considering reported impairment in the home, {{CHILD_NAME}} will benefit from implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning as described below.
#### w/ depression and anxiety
##### standard
Inattention and hyperactivity represented an additional domain of symptoms consistently reported in the present evaluation. While the range and severity of symptoms reported were sufficient to meet criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, combined presentation, it is unclear that these symptoms would occur outside of the context of depression and anxiety; this is a key criteria for the establishment of the diagnosis of ADHD. Depressive and anxiety disorders are characterized by symptoms of diminished ability to think, psychomotor agitation and poor concentration, similar to symptoms that characterize ADHD. As such, it is likely that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety and depressive symptomatology may, at least in part, explain the severity of inattentive and hyperactive symptoms reported during the evaluation. To the extent that these factors contribute to his/her ADHD symptoms, improvements in attention would be expected with effective treatment of the underlying disorders. If {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms of inattention do not remit after targeted interventions addressing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s depression and anxiety, then further consideration of an ADHD diagnosis would be merited.
##### w/ past ADHD diagnosis
Regarding attention, although {{CHILD_NAME}} was previously diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) at age XX, per semi-structured psychiatric interview, he/she does not meet criteria for this diagnosis. The onset of significant symptoms of inattention was reportedly in junior high school and it is unclear that these symptoms would occur outside of the context of depression and anxiety; this is a key criteria for the establishment of the diagnosis of ADHD. Depressive and anxiety disorders are characterized by symptoms of diminished ability to think, psychomotor agitation and poor concentration, similar to symptoms that characterize ADHD. As such, it is likely that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety and depressive symptomatology primarily explain the severity of inattentive symptoms executive functioning difficulty reported during the evaluation. To the extent that these factors contribute to his/her ADHD symptoms, improvements in attention would be expected with effective treatment of the underlying disorders. If {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms of inattention do not remit after targeted interventions addressing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s depression and anxiety, then further consideration of an ADHD diagnosis would be merited.
### No ADHD/Subthreshold
#### standard
{{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} completed the K-SADS semi-structured psychiatric interview for DSM-5 as well as several questionnaires related to emotional and behavioral function. These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} presents with X/9 frequent/occasional/rare symptoms of inattention and X/9 frequent/occasional/rare symptoms of impulsivity/hyperactivity. Six symptoms are typically required in either category for a diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). While {{CHILD_NAME}} does not meet criteria for ADHD, it will be important to monitor his/her existing symptoms to determine if there is any increase in severity.
#### w/ ASD
With regard to attention, concerns were noted by {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parents regarding his/her executive functioning. The current evaluation did not find evidence of symptoms sufficient for a diagnosis of an attention disorder, however, it is important to note that ASD is characterized by executive functioning weakness, diminished ability to think and psychomotor agitation, similar to symptoms that characterize ADHD.  As such, it is likely that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety and rigidity, at least in part, explains the sub-clinical inattention symptoms reported during the evaluation. Continued implementation of strategies to improve and accommodate for his/her executive functioning is suggested, as described below. If {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms of inattention do not remit or further impairment is noted, then further consideration of an ADHD diagnosis would be merited.
#### w/ Lang and Academic Difficulties
##### with clinically significant teacher report
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} is a well-adjusted young child who is caring and socially adept. Regarding attention, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s teacher endorsed clinically significant concerns regarding attention and following directions in class. {{PARENT_NAME}} noted more mild concerns, not at a clinically significant level warranting an ADHD diagnosis. Testing observations indicate {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrates good focus when concepts are broken down and he/she is provided with support. It is important to note that children who have learning disabilities and language deficits can present as inattentive, when in fact they are having difficulty understanding/processing the presented concepts. Although he/she does not meet criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD at this time, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s attention should be closely monitored. If ADHD symptoms persist following implementation of academic supports, or increased impairment is noted, further evaluation may be considered.
##### without clinically significant report
Regarding attention, {{PARENT_NAME}} reported some symptoms of inattention, but not at a clinically significant level warranting an ADHD diagnosis. It is important to note that children with language and academic weaknesses can present as inattentive, when in fact they are having difficulty understanding/processing the presented concepts. To the extent that language delays contribute to his/her inattentive symptoms, improvements in attention would be expected with effective treatment and support geared towards academic and language deficits. If symptoms of inattention persist following implementation of academic supports, or increased impairment is noted, further evaluation may be considered.
#### Late onset and concurrent academic difficulties
{{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} indicated that in 6th grade, he/she began having difficulty sustaining his/her attention and utilizing executive skills. It is important to note that children with academic weaknesses can present as inattentive, when in fact they are having difficulty understanding/processing the presented concepts. To the extent that learning difficulty contributes to his/her inattentive symptoms, improvements in attention would be expected with effective treatment and support geared towards academic deficits. As such, it is critical for {{CHILD_NAME}} to receive comprehensive psychological testing including assessments of her cognitive and academic profile. Considering the late onset of his/her symptoms and history of learning difficulty, he/she does not meet criteria for a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder at this time. If symptoms of inattention persist following implementation of academic supports, or increased impairment is noted, further evaluation may be considered. Recommendations to to improve his/her executive skills are provided below.
#### w/ anxiety
Lastly, {{PARENT_NAME}} reported mild concerns regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s attention and hyperactivity, but not at a level meeting criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD. Teacher reports were not available. It is important to note that executive functioning weaknesses and anxiety are characterized by symptoms of diminished ability to think, psychomotor agitation and poor concentration, similar to symptoms that characterize ADHD. As such, it is likely that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety and executive regulation difficulty, at least in part, explains the sub-clinical ADHD symptoms reported during the evaluation.
#### w/ anxiety and language
{{CHILD_NAME}}'s parents also reported concerns regarding inattention and hyperactivity. His/Her teacher similarly noted difficulty staying on task and sustaining attention. Although the number of endorsed symptoms in the clinical interview meets criteria for a diagnosis, parent and teacher questionnaires did not indicate clinically significant levels of inattention. It is important to note that anxiety disorders are characterized by symptoms of diminished ability to think, psychomotor agitation and poor concentration, similar to symptoms that characterize ADHD. To the extent that anxiety contributes to ADHD, improvements would be expected with effective treatment of his/her anxiety. If {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms of inattention do not remit or further impairment is noted, then further consideration of an ADHD diagnosis would be merited. As such, it is likely that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety, at least in part, explains the sub-clinical ADHD symptoms reported during the evaluation. Additionally, children with language delays can present as inattentive, when in fact they are having difficulty understanding the presented concepts; testing behavioral observations indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrates above average ability to sustain attention, when provided with support to ensure that he/she understands task expectations. To the extent that anxiety and language delays contribute to symptoms of ADHD, improvements in attention would be expected with effective treatment of anxiety and addition of support in the classroom. If {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms of inattention do not remit after targeted interventions addressing anxiety and increased classroom support, then further consideration of an ADHD diagnosis would be merited.
#### w/ past dx
##### w/ ASD, OCD, anxiety
Lastly, {{CHILD_NAME}} has a history of diagnosis and treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder' predominantly inattentive presentation (ADHD), however the current evaluation did not find sufficient evidence for continuation of this diagnosis. {{PARENT_NAME}} reported mild concerns regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s attention and hyperactivity, but not at a level meeting criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD. Furthermore, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s neurocognitive profile of strong executive functioning skills was inconsistent with a typical profile of individuals diagnosed with ADHD.  Teacher reports also did not indicate significant inattention, rather {{CHILD_NAME}}'s teacher endorsed more prominent symptoms of anxiety and social problems. Although {{CHILD_NAME}} endorsed significant difficulty paying attention, it is important to note that ASD and anxiety are characterized by symptoms of diminished ability to think, psychomotor agitation and poor concentration, similar to symptoms that characterize ADHD.  As such, it is likely that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety and rigidity, at least in part, explains the sub-clinical inattention symptoms reported during the evaluation. To the extent that anxiety contributes, improvements would be expected with effective treatment of his/her OCD and adaptability. If {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms of inattention do not remit or further impairment is noted, then further consideration of an ADHD diagnosis would be merited.
##### w/ anxiety
Regarding his/her previous diagnosis of ADHD, current reports from {{CHILD_NAME}}, his/her parent and his/her teachers indicate that inattentive symptoms are not interfering with his/her school performance. This can be partly attributed to accommodations and support which {{CHILD_NAME}} receives in his/her current special education classroom setting. {{CHILD_NAME}} and {{PARENT_NAME}} did however indicate that they continue to notice more significant inattention in the home. It is important to emphasize that anxiety disorders are characterized by symptoms of diminished ability to think, psychomotor agitation and poor concentration, similar to symptoms that characterize ADHD. To the extent that anxiety contributes, improvements in attention would be expected with continued effective treatment of his/her anxiety. Currently, {{CHILD_NAME}} does not meet criteria for a diagnosis. It is not uncommon that children exhibit changes in symptomatology over the course of childhood and adolescence. As such, periodic reassessment of symptom levels is warranted. {{CHILD_NAME}} will benefit from continued implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning as described below.
#### w/late onset of symptoms and gifted
{{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parents also reported concerns regarding his/her work completion of late. {{CHILD_NAME}} indicated that in XX grade, he/she began having difficulty sustaining his/her attention and utilizing executive skills. Although he/she does not meet criteria for a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, due to the late emergence of his/her symptoms, he/she requires support to improve his executive skills. When gifted students, such as {{CHILD_NAME}}, are not provided with challenging academic demands, they are at risk of becoming accustomed to a relaxed approach to learning. Subsequently, this can lead to underachievement, particularly as the curriculum develops becomes more complex and abstract, and independent-learner demands are increased.
#### w/ temper outbursts
Inattention and hyperactivity represented an additional domain of symptoms consistently reported in the present evaluation. The range and severity of symptoms reported were insufficient to meet criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, however {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrated executive functioning and behavioral regulation difficulties which are often associated with ADHD. At the present time, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s severe behavioral dysregulation makes it difficult to assess his/her capacity to pay attention in school, because his/her temper outbursts often preclude him/her from participating in instruction. As such, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s attention and hyperactivity levels should be re-evaluated following therapeutic intervention to reduce the frequency of outbursts and increase his/her tolerance for frustration. Once he/she is placed in an appropriate setting which can meet his/her behavioral needs, a diagnosis of ADHD can be more accurately ruled-out.
#### w/ IDD
Lastly, {{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed frequent symptoms of inattention for {{CHILD_NAME}} at school, but less so within the home. His/Her responses on questionnaires did not indicate a clinical level of impairment warranting an ADHD diagnosis. It is important to note, that children with developmental delays and academic weaknesses can present as inattentive, when in fact they are having difficulty understanding the presented concepts
#### Subthreshold concerns
The results of the testing from {{CHILD_NAME}}'s participation in the Healthy Brain Network at the Child Mind Institute, did not reveal any areas warranting a clinical diagnosis. {{CHILD_NAME}} presents as an intelligent and driven young man/woman with a strong and independent personality. Although concerns were noted by {{PARENT_NAME}} regarding inattention and hyperactivity, questionnaires and interview did not indicate clinically significant levels of symptoms. Furthermore, {{CHILD_NAME}} denied significant difficulty with attention and hyperactivity, stating that he/she was more hyperactive in the past, but these symptoms have subsided. Given his/her obtained neuropsychological profile (i.e., personal weakness in executive functioning skills), his/her attention should be closely monitored. Despite not meeting criteria for a diagnosis, {{CHILD_NAME}} will benefit from strategies to address executive functioning and study skills. If ADHD symptoms persist following implementation of executive functioning strategies, or increased impairment is noted, further evaluation and the addition of psychopharmacologic therapies may be considered. The results of the remaining emotional and behavioral assessments revealed appropriate functioning within social and emotional domains.
#### w/ Lang and Mood or Anx
Regarding attention, {{PARENT_NAME}} reported some concerns regarding symptoms of inattention, but not at a clinically significant level warranting an ADHD diagnosis. Similarly, his/her teacher did not indicate clinical concern on a questionnaire. It is important to note that children with language and academic weaknesses can present as inattentive, when in fact they are having difficulty understanding/processing the presented concepts. It is also important to note that depressive and anxiety disorders are characterized by symptoms of diminished ability to think, psychomotor agitation and poor concentration, similar to symptoms that characterize ADHD. As such, to the extent that these factors contribute to his/her inattention symptoms, improvements would be expected with effective treatment of the underlying disorders. Given {{CHILD_NAME}}'s obtained neuropsychological profile (i.e., deficits in executive functioning, mental flexibility and organization), his/her attention should be closely monitored. If ADHD symptoms persist following implementation of therapeutic and academic supports, or increased impairment is noted, further evaluation may be considered.
#### w/ sleep problems and SLD
Significant concerns were also noted by {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her mother regarding inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive symptoms. However, it is important to note that sleep disorders can mimic ADHD symptoms. Furthermore, children who have learning weaknesses and anxiety can present as inattentive, when in fact they are having difficulty concentrating due to difficulty understanding/processing the presented concepts as well as emotional dysregulation. Although his/her inattention and hyperactive symptoms are clinically significant and would typically warrant diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined presentation, this diagnosis is listed as a rule-out pending further investigation into sleep and adding support for his/her learning disorders. To the extent that these factors contribute to his/her ADHD symptoms, improvements in attention would be expected with effective treatment of his/her anxiety and sleep  as well as appropriate support in school, with instruction modified to his/her ability level.
### Previous Diagnosis
#### ADHD-I to ADHD-H
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD, Combined Presentation. Although previously diagnosed with a predominantly inattentive presentation of ADHD, current reports indicate significant hyperactivity symptoms which are somewhat controlled by medication but continue to interfere with {{CHILD_NAME}}'s functioning across settings. Furthermore, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s neurocognitive profile (i.e. deficits in executive functioning) is also consistent with the diagnosis. As stated previously, {{CHILD_NAME}} requires continued support in school to accommodate for executive functioning weaknesses. Psychotherapeutic approaches are suggested below.
#### by hx w/ ASD and Anxiety
##### ADHD diagnosis
{{CHILD_NAME}}'s parent reported concerns regarding both inattentive and hyperactive behaviors, and he/she currently carries a diagnosis of ADHD that dates back to YEAR. On standardized testing, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s profile was consistent with weakness in executive functioning as well difficulties with sustained and controlled attention. Per semi-structured psychiatric interview and {{PARENT_NAME}}'s questionnaire report, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s level of inattention and hyperactive symptoms reflects his/her current diagnosis of ADHD. The diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder' Combined presentation is listed below to reflect the presence of both significant inattentive and hyperactive symptoms. It is important to note that symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity are common in children diagnosed with ASD and anxiety disorders, and improvement in ADHD symptoms would be expected with treatment of these disorders. Continued implementation of behavioral strategies and plans may be used to manage {{CHILD_NAME}}'s activity level and help him/her focus on tasks.
##### no ADHD diagnosis
Lastly, {{CHILD_NAME}} self-reported significant inattention and hyperactive symptoms in questionnaires and clinical interview. Alternatively, significant concerns regarding attention and hyperactivity were denied by {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parent and previous teacher. It is important to note that anxiety disorders are characterized by symptoms of diminished ability to think, psychomotor agitation and poor concentration, similar to symptoms that characterize ADHD. As such, it is likely that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety may, at least in part, explain the symptoms he/she reported during the evaluation. To the extent that these factors contribute to his/her ADHD symptoms, improvements in attention would be expected with effective treatment of his/her anxiety. If {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms of inattention do not remit after targeted interventions addressing anxiety, or further impairment is noted, then further consideration of an ADHD diagnosis would be merited.
#### by hx (current subclinical) w/ Mood and Anx
##### inattentive presentation w/ subclinical parental report, significant self-report and currently improved with medication
Additionally, {{CHILD_NAME}} has a previous diagnosis of ADHD, Predominantly inattentive presentation, for which he/she currently takes medication. Current reports revealed subclinical parental report of inattentive symptoms and inconsistent executive functioning performance on neurocognitive tests. Alternatively, {{CHILD_NAME}} endorsed more clinically significant inattentive symptoms in interviews and questionnaires and reportedly strongly identifies with his/her ADHD diagnosis. It is important to note that anxiety disorders are characterized by symptoms of diminished ability to think, psychomotor agitation and poor concentration, similar to symptoms that characterize ADHD. Considering the onset of {{CHILD_NAME}}'s difficulty with attention coincided with a depressive episode and increase in anxiety, it is likely that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s emotional dysregulation primarily accounts for his/her reported inattentive symptoms. To the extent that these factors contribute to his/her ADHD symptoms, improvements in attention would be expected with effective treatment of his/her anxiety. Despite subclinical evidence of ADHD on the current evaluation, the diagnosis is listed below, by history, to reflect his/her previous diagnosis and current stimulant medication regimen which is reportedly effective in improving his/her attention.
##### currently improved with accommodations
Regarding his/her previous diagnosis of ADHD, current reports from {{CHILD_NAME}}, his/her parent and his/her teachers indicate that inattentive symptoms are not interfering with his/her school performance. This can be partly attributed to accommodations and support which {{CHILD_NAME}} receives in his/her current special education classroom setting. {{CHILD_NAME}} and {{PARENT_NAME}} did however indicate that they continue to notice more significant inattention in the home. It is important to emphasize that anxiety disorders are characterized by symptoms of diminished ability to think, psychomotor agitation and poor concentration, similar to symptoms that characterize ADHD. To the extent that anxiety contributes, improvements in attention would be expected with continued effective treatment of his/her anxiety. Currently, {{CHILD_NAME}} does not meet criteria for a diagnosis. It is not uncommon that children exhibit changes in symptomatology over the course of childhood and adolescence. As such, periodic reassessment of symptom levels is warranted. {{CHILD_NAME}} will benefit from continued implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning as described below.
##### currently improved with medication and accommodations
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} is a well-adjusted and emotionally stable young man/woman with many adaptive strengths. With regards to his/her longstanding diagnosis of ADHD, current reports indicate that he/she does not fulfill sufficient criteria for ongoing active ADHD diagnosis which supports that his/her symptoms appear to be well managed by his/her current psychopharmacological regimen as well as support he/she receives in his/her current school placement (i.e. small supportive setting, focus teacher). It is important to note that children who have intellectual weaknesses, as described above, can present as inattentive, when in fact they are having difficulty concentrating due to difficulty understanding/processing the presented concepts. To the extent that these factors have contributed to {{CHILD_NAME}}'s ADHD symptoms, continued improvements in attention would be expected with support in school, with instruction modified to his/her ability level. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s neurocognitive profile (i.e., profound deficit in processing speed), indicates that he/she continues to require accommodations and executive functioning support in order to complete his/her work. The diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder'Predominantly inattentive presentation is listed below by history. Continued psychotherapeutic intervention including psychopharmacology and implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning are suggested, as described below.
#### Previous dx, no symptoms reported in HBN eval:
Regarding attention, {{CHILD_NAME}} has a previous diagnosis of ADHD (specific presentation unspecified), for which he/she currently takes medication. Current reports revealed subclinical parental report of inattentive and hyperactive symptoms. Teacher reports were not available. Symptom reporting obtained in the context of this evaluation fails to support that {{CHILD_NAME}} has fulfilled diagnostic criteria for ADHD, currently or in the past.' That said, retrospective reporting can be challenging and is a limitation of this assessment.' Many children notice improvement in their attention and focus with stimulant medications such as Vyvanse regardless of if they have an underlying attentional disorder.' If ADHD were present, certainly the Vyvanse could treat ADHD symptoms.' Nonetheless, if longitudinal clinical evaluation fails to support active symptoms of ADHD, it may be reasonable to taper and, perhaps, discontinue the stimulant medication with close monitoring for recurrent attentional symptoms.
### Subclinical ADHD Questionnaires
#### combined presentation
##### no teacher concern
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} presents with inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive symptoms that are consistent with a diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined presentation. Behavioral observations over the course of the evaluation also indicated strong agreement with an ADHD diagnosis. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s teacher did not endorse significant concerns regarding attention on a questionnaire, suggesting that he/she is responding well to the current support and structure reportedly provided to him/her at school. His/Her intelligence also may allow him/her to compensate for attention deficits, which will become increasingly difficult as work demands increase in coming grades. Psychotherapeutic intervention, including psychopharmacology and implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning are suggested, as described below.
##### moderate teacher concern, well controlled
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} presents with inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive symptoms that are consistent with a diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined presentation. Teacher report also indicated moderate concern for attention problems; however, the teacher indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} is well behaved overall and does not demonstrate significant rule-breaking or aggressive behaviors. {{CHILD_NAME}} appears to have made progress in his/her ability to regulate his/her behavior and attention since when he/she was in pre-school, and his/her current setting is reportedly appropriate for him/her. It is not uncommon that children with ADHD exhibit changes in symptomatology over the course of childhood, as they begin to receive support. As such, periodic reassessment of symptom levels is warranted. Psychotherapeutic intervention, including psychopharmacological consultation and executive functioning support is recommended below.
#### hyperactive/impulsive presentation with reported improvement
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation, due to the number, frequency and severity of his/her endorsed symptoms. His/Her parent/teacher similarly indicated in an interview that {{CHILD_NAME}} displays a high level of hyperactivity in the classroom, which interferes with his/her learning. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s neurocognitive profile on objective testing (i.e. poor performance on executive functioning tasks) as well as behavioral observations during testing, further support this diagnosis. {{PARENT_NAME}} indicated a sub-clinical level of inattention in some reports, while on others, his/her symptoms were reported to be clinically significant. This can be attributed to {{CHILD_NAME}}'s reported improvement in his/her ability to sustain attention, since starting in a classroom setting which is better suited to {{CHILD_NAME}}'s learning style. It is not uncommon that children with ADHD exhibit changes in symptomatology over the course of childhood and adolescence. As such, periodic reassessment of symptom levels is warranted. Psychotherapeutic treatment of ADHD, as well as continued implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning are recommended (see below).
#### inattentive presentation
##### no school report, subclinical parent questionnaires
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly inattentive presentation, due to the number, frequency and severity of his/her endorsed symptoms. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s neurocognitive profile on objective testing (i.e. poor performance on executive functioning tasks) as well as behavioral observations during testing, further supports this diagnosis. Confirmation from a school report would be optimal. {{PARENT_NAME}} indicated a sub-clinical level of inattention in some reports, while on others, his/her symptoms were reported to be clinically significant. This can be attributed to {{CHILD_NAME}}'s reported improvement in his/her ability to sustain attention, since starting in a more supportive classroom setting. It is not uncommon that children with ADHD exhibit changes in symptomatology over the course of childhood and adolescence. As such, periodic reassessment of symptom levels is warranted. {{CHILD_NAME}} will benefit from continued implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning as described below.
##### subclinical teacher questionnaires
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} presents with inattentive symptoms that are consistent with a diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly Inattentive presentation. Mild symptoms of hyperactivity were also endorsed. Behavioral observations (i.e. needing redirection, short attention span, requested frequent repetition), similarly indicated strong agreement with an ADHD diagnosis. Alternatively, teacher report indicated sub-clinical inattention, possibly because the inattentive presentation of ADHD can be less disruptive in the classroom. Additionally, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parents report that his/her teachers provide informal support to {{CHILD_NAME}}, which he/she responds very well to, which can also explain the absence of reported impairment in school. Psychotherapeutic intervention, psychopharmacology consultation and continued implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning is suggested, as described below.
### ADHD dx with associated symptoms
#### Sluggish Cognitive Tempo
##### w/ ADHD dx
It is also worth noting that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s profile is consistent with Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT), a cognitive-emotional style that is commonly described in research literature but is not a DSM diagnosis. The five typical characteristics are 'daydreaming', 'being confused', 'staring blankly', 'being sluggish' and 'being unmotivated.' SCT has also been found to be associated with social impairment, primarily social withdrawal. While these symptoms overlap with ADHD, it might be useful for professionals who work with {{CHILD_NAME}} to be aware of this profile and make accommodations and address interventions accordingly.
##### w/o ADHD dx
It is also worth noting that though he/she does not fulfill diagnostic criteria for a separate diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), {{CHILD_NAME}}'s profile is consistent with Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT), a cognitive-emotional style that is commonly described in research literature but is not a DSM diagnosis. {{CHILD_NAME}} moves slowly and often daydreams, along with pronounced weaknesses in processing speed on cognitive testing. The five typical characteristics are 'daydreaming', 'being confused', 'staring blankly', 'being sluggish' and 'being unmotivated.' SCT has also been found to be associated with social impairment, primarily social withdrawal. While these symptoms can overlap with several ADHD symptoms, it may be useful for professionals working with {{CHILD_NAME}} to consider SCT in their diagnostic conceptualization.
#### w/ Anxiety
These reports also indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} continues to meet criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined presentation. Although {{PARENT_NAME}} did not indicate significant symptoms in questionnaires, he/she and {{CHILD_NAME}} both endorsed clinically significant symptoms in the diagnostic interview. Behavioral observations by the examiner also revealed clinically relevant impairment associated with ADHD. It is important to note that anxiety disorders are characterized by symptoms of diminished ability to think, psychomotor agitation and poor concentration, similar to symptoms that characterize ADHD. As such, it is likely that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety symptomatology may, at least in part, contribute to the severity of inattentive and hyperactive symptoms reported during the evaluation. To the extent that these factors contribute to his/her ADHD symptoms, improvements in attention would be expected with effective treatment of his/her anxiety.
OR
#### w/ ASD
These reports also indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} presents with inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive symptoms that are consistent with a diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined presentation. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s testing profile on neurocognitive tests (i.e. difficulty with attention) as well as his/her observed behaviors during testing, similarly indicated strong agreement with an ADHD diagnosis. It is important to note that autistic traits can mimic behaviors associated with ADHD. As such, a portion of the symptoms reported in these domains, may be accounted for by the presence of an autism spectrum disorder. However, reports and observations indicate that the severity of {{CHILD_NAME}}'s difficulty focusing extends beyond the level typically accounted for ASD and warrants separate diagnosis. Psychotherapeutic intervention and implementation of strategies to improve and accommodate for his/her executive functioning is suggested, as described below.
#### w/ Language/academic delays
##### Inattentive Presentation
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} continues to present with inattentive symptoms that are consistent with a diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly inattentive presentation. Teacher reports were not available. It is important to note that children who have intellectual weaknesses can present as inattentive, when in fact they are having difficulty concentrating due to not understanding/processing the presented concepts. To the extent that these factors contribute to his/her ADHD symptoms, improvements in attention would be expected with instruction modified to his/her ability level. However, reports and observations indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s difficulty focusing extends beyond situations in which he/she does not understand the task demands. As such, psychotherapeutic intervention including psychopharmacology and implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning are suggested, as described below.
##### Combined Presentation
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} presents with inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive symptoms that are consistent with a diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined presentation. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s testing profile on neurocognitive tests (i.e. difficulty with processing speed, working memory and attention) as well as his/her observed behaviors during testing, similarly indicated strong agreement with an ADHD diagnosis. Teacher report also indicated significant inattention in the classroom. It is important to note that children with language and academic weaknesses can present as inattentive, when in fact they are having difficulty understanding/processing the presented concepts. However, reports and observations indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s difficulty focusing extends beyond situations in which he/she might not understand what is expected. Psychotherapeutic intervention and implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning is suggested, as described below
#### w/ Mood
##### Inattentive Presentation
Lastly, these reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly inattentive presentation, due to the number, frequency and severity of his/her endorsed symptoms. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s neurocognitive profile on objective testing (i.e. poor performance on a test of attention) further supports this diagnosis. It is important to note that children with academic weaknesses can present as inattentive, when in fact they are having difficulty understanding/processing the presented concepts. It is also crucial to recognize the role that mood and anxiety plays in executive functioning, as emotional dysregulation is characterized by symptoms of diminished ability to think, psychomotor agitation and poor concentration, similar to symptoms that characterize ADHD. However, considering {{CHILD_NAME}}'s difficulty with attention reportedly pre-dates his/her depression symptoms, an ADHD diagnosis is appropriate in characterizing his/her symptoms. To the extent that mood factors contribute to his/her ADHD symptoms, improvements in attention would be expected with effective treatment of his/her emotional regulation as well as appropriate support in school, with instruction modified to his/her ability level. Psychotherapeutic intervention, medication and implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning is suggested, as described below.
##### Combined Presentation
{{CHILD_NAME}} also has a longstanding diagnosis of ADHD (for which he/she currently takes medication). Results of the current evaluation indicate that he/she continues to meet criteria for a diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder' Combined presentation. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s severe executive functioning difficulty on neurocognitive tests further supports this diagnosis. {{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed sufficient symptoms for a diagnosis in the diagnostic interview but did not indicate clinically elevated attention difficulty on questionnaires; this is likely due to the high level of support {{CHILD_NAME}} received in school this past year as well as the effectiveness of his/her prescribed stimulant medication. It is important to note that symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity are common in children diagnosed with mood disorders, and improvement in ADHD symptoms would be expected with treatment of these underlying disorders. Continued implementation of executive and behavioral strategies should continue to be implemented in school and at home (see below).
#### w/ Poor Coping Skills
{{PARENT_NAME}} expressed additional concerns regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s behavior. Occasionally, {{CHILD_NAME}} will DESCRIBE BX. During clinical interview, {{CHILD_NAME}} reported engaging in this behavior ADD REASON. It is important to note that children and adolescents with ADHD are at increased risk for anxiety or depressive disorders. Currently, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms are not at the severity level for a diagnosis of an anxiety or mood disorder. However, he/she will benefit from developing adaptive coping strategies to manage environmental stressors. In part, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s behaviors may represent a maladaptive coping response to environmental stressors that trigger EMOTION. Thus, cognitive behavioral therapy is recommended to address these symptoms and may be helpful in augmenting {{CHILD_NAME}}'s repertoire of adaptive coping strategies that can be applied to psychosocial and family stressors.
#### w/ Temper Outbursts
During the evaluation, {{PARENT_NAME}} also expressed concerns regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s longstanding history of low frustration tolerance and emotional outbursts. Emotional outbursts are common in children with ADHD. These children often lack an understanding of emotions and the adaptive skills necessary to cope with them, as well as the social communication skills to convey frustration and negative feelings. Emotional outbursts may therefore serve as a child's only means of communicating frustration or negative feelings. Although sometimes intense in nature, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s outbursts are reportedly triggered by events that likely produce frustration and disappointment (e.g., ______). They do not occur in the context of chronically irritable mood and thus do not clearly suggest the presence of a mood disorder at this time.'Nonetheless,'cognitive behavioral therapy and parent management training is recommended to address these symptoms and may be helpful in augmenting {{CHILD_NAME}}'s repertoire of adaptive coping strategies that can be applied to psychosocial and family stressors.
#### w/ Social Vulnerability and ASD concerns
##### recommended social skills group
Finally, it is worth noting that the social vulnerabilities reported by {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent do not indicate clinical concern for an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals affected by ADHD. Specifically, children with ADHD are at a higher risk for rejection by their peers, due to poor social skills associated with behavior regulation difficulty and poor frustration tolerance (e.g., bossy, intrusive, inflexible, controlling, annoying, explosive, argumentative, inattentive during organized sports/games, and violating the rules of the game). As such, treatment of ADHD symptoms should improve his/her social relationships. Additionally, it is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} participate in a social skills group (as described below).
##### recommended school counseling
Finally, it is worth noting that {{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed concerns related to social problems, specifically social awareness, social cognition and social motivation, as per the questionnaires. Despite these, clinical concern for an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis is not indicated. Autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals affected by ADHD. Specifically, children with ADHD are at a higher risk for rejection by their peers, due to poor social skills associated with behavior regulation difficulty and poor frustration tolerance (e.g., bossy, intrusive, inflexible, controlling, annoying, explosive, argumentative, inattentive during organized sports/games, and violating the rules of the game). As such, treatment of ADHD symptoms should improve his/her social relationships. Additionally, it is recommended that social skills be addressed in his/her school counseling sessions.
#### w/ Stress at Home
Lastly, these reports continue to indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} presents with inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive symptoms that are consistent with his/her diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Combined presentation. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s testing profile on neurocognitive tests (i.e. difficulty with processing speed and attention) similarly indicated strong agreement with an ADHD diagnosis. Teacher reports were not available. It is important to note that children who endure stressful home environments and have associated anxiety can present as inattentive, when in fact they are having difficulty concentrating due to emotional dysregulation. However, reports and observations indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s difficulty focusing preceded changes in his/her mood and meet criteria for a separate diagnosis. Psychotherapeutic intervention including psychopharmacology and implementation of strategies to improve his/her executive functioning are suggested, as described below.
## Adjustment Disorder
### past dx
#### w/ Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct
Parental report indicates that {{CHILD_NAME}} is a bright child who is passionate about hobbies he/she is interested in but does not appear motivated or engaged in school. They endorsed concerns regarding his/her social emotional functioning including low frustration tolerance and frequent anger; {{CHILD_NAME}} seems to internalize stressful events in his/her environment. In a particularly stressful XX-month period for {{CHILD_NAME}} between MONTH YEAR and MONTH YEAR, he/she became avoidant of school, developed somatic symptoms and expressed thoughts of not wanting to be alive. A past diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct is appropriate in characterizing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms during that period. Currently, {{PARENT_NAME}} denied that {{CHILD_NAME}} is persistently irritable or depressed at a severity level warranting a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder or Persistent Depressive Disorder (formerly Dysthymia). Furthermore, as {{CHILD_NAME}} does not display persistently irritable mood, a diagnosis of DMDD is not warranted.
#### w/ Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood
Additionally, {{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed a past XX-month period for {{CHILD_NAME}}, in which he/she displayed a change in mood and increase in anxiety, in conjunction with bullying and taunting at his/her school. Thus, a past diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed Mood is also appropriate. {{CHILD_NAME}} can be sensitive to stressful events and has a tendency to internalize conflicts. He/She will thus benefit from coping skills for his/her anxiety.
#### w/ Depression
In addition, as reported by {{PARENT_NAME}}, {{CHILD_NAME}} experienced two discrete episodes of worsening symptoms with direct temporal relation to his/her current life stressors. These symptoms included depressed mood, anhedonia, fatigue, increased difficulty concentrating, decreased appetite, weight loss, insomnia and distorted negative cognitions. These symptoms were reported to cause impairment in his/her school setting; impairment in social and family settings was denied. As these symptoms developed in direct response to specific stressors, a past diagnosis Adjustment Disorder, with depressed mood is given. As reported, {{CHILD_NAME}} met criteria for this disorder for two episodes. Currently, the majority of these symptoms have remitted. The remainder of present symptoms can be attributed to his/her diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.
#### Adjustment Disorder, with Disturbance of Conduct
In addition, a number of behavioral and emotional concerns were endorsed for {{CHILD_NAME}} during the clinical interview. {{PARENT_NAME}} reported that {{CHILD_NAME}} experienced frequent/occasional temper outbursts and argumentativeness at home during a time of increased stress and transition from DATE to DATE. His/Her symptoms at that time met criteria for Adjustment Disorder, with disturbance of conduct. These symptoms have since remitted and do not currently meet criteria for any diagnosis. If these symptoms recur, [CS1]cognitive behavioral therapy and parent management training is recommended to address these symptoms and may be helpful in augmenting {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her family's repertoire of adaptive coping strategies that can be applied to psychosocial and family stressors. If the pattern of oppositional behaviors persists, then he/she should be re-evaluated to rule out Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). As {{CHILD_NAME}}'s emotional outbursts did not occur within the context of chronic irritability, a mood disorder diagnosis is not indicated at this time.[CS2]
### w/ Anxiety
{{PARENT_NAME}} also reported significant concerns regarding school refusal behavior for {{CHILD_NAME}} during his/her 3rd grade year. He/She became very avoidant of attending school, had frequent somatic complaints and expressed worries concerning his/her academic performance. It is important to note that children diagnosed with ADHD and learning difficulties are at risk for increased anxiety, due to the frustration they experience in executing executive functioning skills. As such, improvement in {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety symptoms would be expected with effective treatment of ADHD and additional support in his/her classroom. Although {{CHILD_NAME}} does not currently meet criteria for a diagnosis of any specific anxiety disorder, considering these significant internalizing symptoms appear directly related to environmental stressors (i.e. academic difficulty, need for more support in classroom, teasing by peers), a DSM-5 diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder, with anxiety, is appropriate to account for his/her school refusal. It is strongly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} undergo psychotherapeutic treatment to address his/her emotional regulation skills, improve his/her self-esteem and teach him/her how to adaptively cope with frustration in school. Careful monitoring is recommended to determine if there is any change in symptom presentation or severity as social and academic demands increase. Additionally, continued counseling and psychotherapy using cognitive behavioral techniques (as listed below) is recommended to help {{CHILD_NAME}} learn skills and strategies to handle his/her emotions and frustration adaptively.
### Past Separation Anxiety
{{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent also endorsed subclinical symptoms of separation anxiety and based on reports of his/her past psychiatric history, he/she likely met criteria for this diagnosis up until age XX.
### w/ Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct
#### w/ bullying
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} presents with significant internalizing and externalizing symptoms that appear directly related to environmental stressors (e.g., being bullied at school). A diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct has been added to account for {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms of irritability, sad mood, argumentative behavior, and recent aggression towards peers. {{CHILD_NAME}} also reported a high level of anxiety on questionnaires, which is likely occurring within the context of his/her existing Adjustment Disorder and does not warrant an additional diagnosis at this time. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s behavioral and emotional functioning was reportedly within normal limits prior to episodes of bullying by classmates. It will be important to determine whether the current symptoms decrease following his/her recent transfer to a new school, as primary stressors have been removed.
#### w/ adoption of sister and difficulty with reading
Overall, these reports indicate {{CHILD_NAME}} is a well-adjusted, socially-adept young child who demonstrates social maturity and is in-tune with his/her emotions. However, {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent both endorsed that he/she struggles to regulate his/her emotions and often becomes angry and irritated. At home, {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrates oppositional behavior and can be mean to his/her adoptive sister. Overall, these significant internalizing and externalizing symptoms appear directly related to environmental stressors (i.e. adoption of his/her younger sister, difficulty with reading). Thus, a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct, is appropriate to account for his/her difficulty regulating himself/herself within the home. Furthermore, exceptionally bright children such as {{CHILD_NAME}}, can be at risk for difficulty regulating negative emotions and tolerating frustration. It is strongly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} undergo psychotherapeutic treatment to address his/her emotional regulation skills, improve his/her self-esteem and teach him/her how to adaptively cope with anger toward his/her sister.
#### w/ parental separation
In addition, {{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed that {{CHILD_NAME}} presents with significant internalizing and externalizing symptoms that appear directly related to environmental stressors (i.e., parental separation, custody hearings, lack of academic support). A diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct has been added to account for {{CHILD_NAME}}'s recent symptoms of anxiety, oppositional behavior, low self-esteem, irritability and reluctance to go to school. It will be important to monitor his/her symptoms following the conclusion of court proceedings and future implementation of academic supports. Counseling is recommended in {{CHILD_NAME}}'s school setting to improve his/her adjustment to school and help {{CHILD_NAME}} learn strategies to cope with frustration.
#### w/ sister moving out of home
Regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s mood and emotional regulation, {{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed concerns regarding a recent increase in sadness and irritability, which {{CHILD_NAME}} has also displayed previously, in response to transitions or stressful times within the home. Furthermore, {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly displays frequent temper outbursts and oppositional behavior within the home. Although {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly displays some symptoms of dysthymic mood and irritability (i.e. low self-esteem, indecisiveness, fatigue and loss of pleasure in daily activities), the quantity and persistence of symptoms does not meet criteria for a depressive episode. However, a diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Disturbance of Emotions and Conduct is more appropriate in characterizing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms. {{PARENT_NAME}} reports that his/her current mood and conduct symptoms were precipitated by his/her sister moving out of the home. It is strongly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} undergo psychotherapeutic treatment to address his/her emotional regulation skills, improve his/her self-esteem and teach him/her how to adaptively cope with frustration. It will also be important to monitor his/her emotional functioning during transitions ensure that he/she has appropriate support to adapt to a new environment.
## Anxiety Disorders
### Agoraphobia
In addition, symptoms of anxiety were reported on the CBCL, YSR, and parent and child version of the SCARED questionnaire. The clinical interview clarified that these symptoms are most severe in public or open settings (e.g., ______), as {{CHILD_NAME}} is fearful of not being able to escape or seek help with ease if needed. Given the level of distress/avoidance {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences when in public or open situations, a diagnosis of Agoraphobia is warranted. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful in addressing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety-related symptoms and in augmenting his/her repertoire of adaptive coping strategies that can be applied to additional psychosocial stressors.
### Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
#### standard
In addition, symptoms of anxiety for {{CHILD_NAME}} were reported on the CBCL, YSR, and parent and child version of the SCARED questionnaire. The clinical interview clarified that these symptoms include persistent uncontrollable worries about a number of events or activities (e.g., _____) and are accompanied by somatic or cognitive complaints (e.g., ______). Given the significant distress and related impairment reported in multiple settings, symptom count is sufficient to meet criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful in addressing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety-related symptoms and in augmenting his/her repertoire of adaptive coping strategies.
#### w/ restlessness, skin-picking, tics, irritability and sleep disturbance
{{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences significant generalized anxiety, including persistent worries about a variety of topics. Particular stressors for his/her symptoms of anxiety appear to include loss of behavioral control and worry about others well-being. {{PARENT_NAME}} reports that he/she experiences associated restlessness, skin-picking, tics, irritability and sleep disturbance. Given the severity, frequency and impairment reported by these symptoms, a diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder is warranted.
#### anxiety related to unfamiliar situations, things he/she has said in the past, intruders and the health of people close to him/her with subclinical separation anxiety
Reports also indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} exhibits frequent and persistent anxiety regarding a wide range of matters, including unfamiliar situations, things he/she has said in the past, intruders and the health of people close to him/her. Symptoms related to separation anxiety were also endorsed, but at a level which is no longer clinically significant. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety is reportedly associated with somatic complaints and difficulty concentrating. Behavioral observations in the context of the current evaluation, similarly revealed frequent nervousness regarding his/her performance as well as maladaptive negative self-talk, in which {{CHILD_NAME}} often puts himself/herself down. {{CHILD_NAME}} endorsed that his/her worry can often feel like it is difficult to control and is distressing for him/her. Although {{PARENT_NAME}} indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety is not causing pervasive interference with his/her functioning, a diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder is warranted, considering the wide scope and frequency of {{CHILD_NAME}}'s worries as well as resulting distress. Children, such as {{CHILD_NAME}}, who are advanced intellectually, can be at risk for difficulty regulating negative emotions and perfectionism associated with the high standards they develop for themselves. It is strongly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} undergo psychotherapeutic treatment to address his/her emotional regulation skills, improve his/her self-esteem and teach him/her how to adaptively cope with frustration and worry (as detailed below).
#### Past diagnosis
Reports also indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} previously exhibited frequent and persistent anxiety regarding a wide range of matters, for a period of a year between ages X and X. As such, a past diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder is warranted. It is strongly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} continue to undergo psychotherapeutic treatment to address his/her emotional regulation skills, improve his/her self-esteem and teach him/her how to adaptively cope with frustration and worry (as detailed below).
#### w/ ASD, subclinical fear of the dentist, and checking behavior
Lastly, a range of anxiety symptoms were indicated by {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parent and observed over the course of the present evaluation. Anxiety symptoms frequently co-occur in children with autism spectrum disorders, and some symptoms of anxiety can mimic behaviors commonly observed in children with ASD. Clinical interview revealed persistent and excessive worry which is very difficult for {{CHILD_NAME}} to control. Considering significant impairment in his/her social, academic and familial functioning, a diagnosis of   Generalized Anxiety Disorder is warranted. Although not meeting criteria for additional diagnoses, {{CHILD_NAME}} also reportedly demonstrates excessive fear of the dentist and perseverative and repetitive checking behavior with regards to his/her schedule. It is important to note that compulsive behavior can also be associated with the repetitive behaviors and rigidity found in children with ASD. It is critical that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s behaviors are monitored and that his/her anxiety is addressed in behavioral therapy as suggested below. Pharmacological intervention to address anxiety can also be considered as detailed below, in consultation with {{CHILD_NAME}}'s current pediatrician.
### Other Specified Anxiety Disorder
#### standard
{{CHILD_NAME}} and {{PARENT_NAME}} also reported significant symptoms of anxiety, which manifest as somatic symptoms (e.g., ______) and/or cognitive symptoms (e.g., _______) in situations where {{CHILD_NAME}} feels overwhelmed by stressors (e.g., ________). While his/her symptoms do not fit criteria for a specific anxiety disorder, given the level of distress/impairment that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences, a diagnosis of Other Specified Anxiety Disorder has been added.
#### w/ panic symptoms, generalized worry, social anxiety, and homeschooling
Overall {{CHILD_NAME}} is a friendly, thoughtful and caring young man/woman. He/She indicates that he/she is well adjusted within the context of his/her current educational and social setting. However in questionnaires, {{CHILD_NAME}} endorsed a clinically significant symptoms related to anxiety. Specifically, he/she endorsed panic symptoms (e.g. heart racing, headaches), generalized worry and social anxiety. Upon further interview, {{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} both indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} is shy, but denied impairment as a result. {{CHILD_NAME}} explained that he/she does not have many opportunities to put his/herself in challenging social situations because he/she is home-schooled. While his/her current symptoms do not meet full criteria for a specific anxiety disorder, a diagnosis of Other Specified Anxiety Disorder has been added to best account for his/her reported distress and fear of interacting with people he/she doesn't know well. {{CHILD_NAME}} will benefit from psychotherapy which addresses helping his/her manage these symptoms and making a goal of increasing his/her social opportunities.
EXAMPLE:
{{CHILD_NAME}}[JA4] denied specific triggers that cause anxiety but reported a buildup of events that can occur which can then trigger uncontrollable anxiety (presenting in a somatic way). Examples of triggers include areas that are very noisy or crowded, anticipating criticism for not following directions, making a mistake (e.g., ________). In these instances, {{CHILD_NAME}} feels overwhelmed and will isolate from others or cry. This can last for several hours. {{CHILD_NAME}} and {{PARENT_NAME}} denied that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences frequent uncontrollable worries, separation fears, specific phobias, or social performance anxiety.
#### w/ ADHD Diagnosis
Additionally, {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent endorsed significant symptoms related to separation anxiety, including difficulty separating from caregivers, worrying at night before going to sleep and needing someone nearby. Anxiety was also observed over the course of the current evaluation during timed tasks. {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly has difficulty dealing with frustration in an appropriate manner and exhibits mild emotional outbursts and oppositional behavior when he/she is frustrated. Although {{CHILD_NAME}} does not currently meet criteria for a diagnosis of any specific anxiety disorder, considering the reported impairment that anxiety and difficulty regulating emotions has on {{CHILD_NAME}}'s functioning, a diagnosis of Other Specified Anxiety Disorder is appropriate. It is important to note that children diagnosed with ADHD are at risk for increased anxiety, due to the frustration they experience in executing executive functioning skills. As such, improvement in {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety symptoms would be expected with effective treatment of ADHD. It is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} receive treatment for his/her anxiety symptoms, with careful monitoring to determine if there is any change in symptom presentation or severity as social and academic demands increase. Treatment should include cognitive behavioral techniques (as listed below) to help {{CHILD_NAME}} learn skills and strategies to handle his/her emotions and frustration adaptively.
#### w/ Gifted Child
These reports indicate a range of anxiety symptoms, related to generalized worry, social anxiety and separation. {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly frequently worries and experiences some associated somatic symptoms. {{CHILD_NAME}}, his/her parent and his/her teacher all endorsed his/her worry to be mild and {{CHILD_NAME}} denied that his/her worries are 'out of control.' Socially, {{CHILD_NAME}} is often shy and sometimes avoids situations where he/she will have to meet new people. Regarding separation, {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} has a tendency to worry about his/her parent's well-being and often follows his/her parent wherever he/she goes, however they denied that he/she has difficulty separating. Although {{CHILD_NAME}} does not currently meet criteria for a diagnosis of any specific anxiety disorder, considering the range of his/her anxiety, somatic symptoms and some distress from anxiety, a diagnosis of Other Specified Anxiety Disorder is appropriate. Children, such as {{CHILD_NAME}}, who are gifted, can be at risk for difficulty regulating negative emotions and tolerating frustration. It is strongly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} undergo psychotherapeutic treatment to address his/her emotional regulation skills, improve his/her self-esteem and teach him/her how to adaptively cope with frustration and worry.
#### w/ Trauma Exposure
{{PARENT_NAME}} also endorsed a range of anxiety symptoms for {{CHILD_NAME}}, many of which appear to be precipitated by exposure to violence and the death of {{CHILD_NAME}}'s biological parent. Specifically, {{CHILD_NAME}} displays some symptoms of separation anxiety, shyness and a fear of heights. These symptoms do not meet criteria for a specific anxiety disorder diagnosis, nor does {{CHILD_NAME}} exhibit symptoms consistent with a trauma disorder; however, considering the long-standing nature and range of his/her symptoms as well as reported impairment, a diagnosis of Other Specified Anxiety Disorder is listed below. {{CHILD_NAME}} will benefit from therapy which teaches him/her adaptive coping skills for dealing with anxiety.
### Panic Disorder
#### current
In addition, symptoms of panic for {{CHILD_NAME}} were reported on the CBCL, YSR, and parent and child version of the SCARED questionnaire. The clinical interview clarified that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences recurrent panic attacks, as evidenced by X/13 symptoms of panic (e.g., _____) as well as frequent worries about having another panic attack/significant changes in his/her behavior to avoid having another panic attack. Given the level of distress {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences when having a panic attack, a diagnosis of Panic Disorder is warranted. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful in addressing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s panic-related symptoms and in augmenting his/her repertoire of adaptive coping strategies that can be applied to additional psychosocial stressors.
#### past
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} is experiencing significant somatic anxiety symptoms, which are consistent with a diagnosis of Panic Disorder. From approximately MONTH YEAR to MONTH YEAR, following a stressful situation at {{CHILD_NAME}}'s school, {{CHILD_NAME}} experienced several unexpected attacks including panic symptoms (e.g., heart palpitations, sw
, chest pain, fear of losing control, depersonalization). {{CHILD_NAME}} also reported persistent worry about having future panic attacks, which led him/her to avoid certain social situations. The attacks do not only occur in response to feared social situations or in response to obsessive thoughts, thus warranting a separate diagnosis. {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent also endorsed elevations in generalized anxiety and worry on questionnaires, however, upon clinical interview, it was determined that anxiety symptoms are most closely associated with social situations, and fear of having a panic attack. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety and worry should be monitored by his/her family and therapist to assess if frequency of generalized worry increases.
### Selective Mutism
#### w/ Social Anxiety Disorder
In addition, symptoms of anxiety were reported on the CBCL, YSR, and parent and child version of the SCARED questionnaire. The clinical interview clarified that {{CHILD_NAME}} consistently fails to speak in specific social situations (e.g., _____) despite speaking in other situations (e.g., _____), which often interferes with his/her academic/social functioning. Thus, full criteria are met for a diagnosis of Selective Mutism. It is very common for individuals with Social Anxiety Disorder to also have difficulties speaking in public to the extent that it meets criteria for Selective Mutism.[CS5]
#### Past (K thru 4th Grade)
Regarding anxiety, {{PARENT_NAME}} noted some mild symptoms of social anxiety in the clinical interview and questionnaires. {{CHILD_NAME}} can appear shy and withdrawn around new people (particularly in the past). However, he/she now frequently initiates friendships with others and is appropriate in performance situations. Although he/she does not display clinically significant symptoms currently, {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for a past diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder, based on parental report of shyness and avoidance of social situations when he/she was in kindergarten through 4th grade.
#### Past limited to adults
Significant symptoms of anxiety were raised in the clinical interview and questionnaires. {{CHILD_NAME}} is very shy in communicating with adults and displays minimal affective expression, seemingly shutting down emotionally in these interactions. This was similarly observed in the current evaluation. His/Her shyness with adults is in contrast with his/her reported behavior with friends and family, in which he/she is outgoing, vocal and very cheerful. Although he/she no longer meets full criteria, reports of his/her previous behavior and symptoms are consistent with a past DSM-5 diagnosis of Selective Mutism. {{CHILD_NAME}} has become more communicative and comfortable with adults, however he/she continues to require support to become more expressive with adults. Thus the diagnosis is listed below, in partial remission. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s shyness reportedly interferes in his/her learning, as it inhibits him/her from asking clarifying questions, requesting help, and makes assessing knowledge difficult for school personnel. Psychotherapeutic treatment is recommended, targeting increasing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s verbal and nonverbal communication with adults and in the community. See recommendations for treatment below.
#### R/O
{{CHILD_NAME}} also exhibits some symptoms of selective mutism, as he/she reportedly demonstrates appropriate communication in some settings (with family and small groups of friends) and becomes verbally non-responsive in other contexts (with adults, teachers and authority figures). However, selective mutism is typically characterized by an absence of difficulties in early speech development, and {{CHILD_NAME}} had delayed speech development, not speaking until age X. Furthermore, in the current evaluation he/she displayed articulation deficits which likely contribute to his/her anxiety in speaking in certain contexts. Typically, in selective mutism, children begin to become non-responsive in certain contexts from an earlier age; {{CHILD_NAME}} began to display this behavior at age X or X. Also, even in settings where the child is mute, social reciprocity is usually not impaired; during the current evaluation, {{CHILD_NAME}} appeared completely withdrawn and displayed limited non-verbal communication in addition to limited verbal speech. As such, given the longstanding history of speech and language delays, limited social reciprocity and late onset, this diagnosis is not currently appropriate for {{CHILD_NAME}}. Nevertheless, psychotherapeutic treatment should target social anxiety as well as increasing his/her verbal communication with adults and in the community. See recommendations for treatment below.
### Separation Anxiety Disorder

The reported level of impairment and severity of his/her distress in these situations warrants a diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder. However, teacher and parent report, as well as clinical observation, indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for these disorders and requires therapeutic support for depression and anxiety (as suggested below). {{CHILD_NAME}}'s reports denied symptoms of anxiety and depression, suggesting part of therapy should focus on helping {{CHILD_NAME}} understand his/her emotions and how his/her symptoms interfere with his/her functioning.
#### Home schooled w/ GAD &SAD
Overall, {{CHILD_NAME}} presented as a reserved and insightful young man/woman. He/She indicates that he/she is well adjusted within the context of his/her current educational and social setting; he/she has close friends who understand his/her preference to stay by himself/herself and he/she enjoys the home-school setting which allows him/her to pursue his/her interests.

#### R/O Social Anx w/ ASD
In addition, symptoms of anxiety were reported on parent and child questionnaires. {{PARENT_NAME}} reported the onset of several anxiety symptoms related to at least one social situation in which she/he speculates that {{CHILD_NAME}} is fearful of negative evaluation from others (e.g., being rejected).

Based on insight gathered from {{CHILD_NAME}} (i.e., denied fears of being rejected or embarrassed; expressed he/she feels discouraged about his/her social skills; stated that he/she 'lack[s] self-confidence'), it appears that his/her anxiety is most related to a skills deficit (i.e., lack of understanding of how to appropriately interact with others) as opposed to exclusively being fearful or avoidant of evaluation from others. Thus, at this time, a diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder was considered but rejected due to this distinction. Nonetheless, it is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} seek interventions to enhance his/her social skills, as identified below, and address all of his/her anxiety-related symptoms through cognitive behavioral therapy, as outlined below, to augment his/her repertoire of adaptive coping strategies that can be applied to additional psychosocial stressors.

He/She persistently avoids any performance situation as a result, which significantly interferes in his/her functioning. {{PARENT_NAME}} reports that {{CHILD_NAME}} has always been an anxious child and presented with symptoms which met criteria for Separation Anxiety Disorder, in the past. {{CHILD_NAME}} does not seem to be aware of his/her anxiety and denies generalized worry.
#### w/ ASD
##### w/ past separation anxiety
{{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parents also endorsed significant symptoms of anxiety in the clinical interview and questionnaires.

Although a lot of his/her anxiety may be related to his/her awareness of his/her difficulty with social communication skills associated with his/her history of an Autism Spectrum Disorder, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety also extends beyond situations requiring social language. The level of impairment and severity of his/her distress in these situations warrants a diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder. {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parents also endorsed subclinical symptoms of separation anxiety and based on reports of his/her past psychiatric history, he/she likely met criteria for this diagnosis in the past, however resulting impairment in his/her current functioning was denied.

Nevertheless, in the absence of a medical cause, somatic symptoms can be a manifestation of anxiety and stress. Individuals diagnosed with ADHD are at increased risk for anxiety, due to the frustration they experience in executing executive functioning skills. {{CHILD_NAME}} expressed some low self-esteem regarding his/her academic performance as well as his/her physical appearance. As such, it is critical that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety, self-efficacy and stress level be continuously monitored and therapy can be considered to help his/her manage stress, as academic and social demands likely increase.
##### w/ improvement with psychotherapy
Regarding generalized anxiety, {{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} both report that his/her worrying is no longer persistent or out of control and is more contained to aforementioned separation concerns.

#### Specific Phobia, Blood-injection-injury, Fear of other medical care
{{CHILD_NAME}} also meets criteria for a diagnosis of Specific Phobia related to receiving shots. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s fears generalize to other medically related content (e.g. TV shows), are significantly out of proportion, and are reportedly causing impairment in community settings (i.e., at doctors' visits). A brief course of psychotherapeutic treatment (described below) can address these symptoms of anxiety.
#### Specific Phobia, Blood-injection-injury, Fear of injury
In addition, symptoms of anxiety were reported on the CBCL as well as the parent and child version of the SCARED questionnaire. The clinical interview clarified that {{CHILD_NAME}} is fearful of ________, which extends beyond age-appropriate limits, and experiences related distress or avoidance (e.g., ______) in response to being exposed to this stimulus. Thus, {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for Specific Phobia, which can be addressed within the context of cognitive behavioral therapy.
#### Specific Phobia, Situational (i.e., airplanes, elevators, enclosed places)
In addition, symptoms of anxiety were reported on the CBCL as well as the parent and child version of the SCARED questionnaire. The clinical interview clarified that {{CHILD_NAME}} is fearful of ________, which extends beyond age-appropriate limits, and experiences related distress or avoidance (e.g., ______) in response to being exposed to this stimulus. Thus, {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for Specific Phobia, which can be addressed within the context of cognitive behavioral therapy.
#### Specific Phobia, Other (i.e., situations that may lead to choking or vomiting: in children, e.g., loud sounds or costumed characters).
In addition, symptoms of anxiety were reported on the CBCL as well as the parent and child version of the SCARED questionnaire. The clinical interview clarified that {{CHILD_NAME}} is fearful of ________, which extends beyond age-appropriate limits, and experiences related distress or avoidance (e.g., ______) in response to being exposed to this stimulus. Thus, {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for
#### Subclinical phobia
{{CHILD_NAME}} also reportedly experiences significant fears related to injections, which is distressing for him/her. A diagnosis of specific phobia is not warranted as {{CHILD_NAME}}'s fears are not currently pervasive nor significantly above and beyond his/her developmental level. If his/her fear of injections persists and becomes more problematic, therapy addressing the fear is recommended.
### Subclinical Anxiety Symptoms
#### Subclinical phobia of insects and doctors and subclinical Anxiety
Currently, he/she is also reported to have subclinical symptoms of generalized anxiety and specific phobia (bugs and doctors' offices); however, resulting impairment in his/her functioning was denied.
#### monitor subclinical social anxiety and separation anxiety
These reports did not reveal any areas of significant clinical concern. Overall {{CHILD_NAME}} is a well- adjusted child who has made much progress with his/her social skills and enjoys many extra-curricular activities. Regarding anxiety symptoms, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parents indicated that he/she can be shy and has difficulty initiating interactions with peers. Some anxious behavior was also noted by the examiner during the present evaluation, but not at a level that interfered with his/her performance. In his/her own self reports, {{CHILD_NAME}} noted some separation anxiety, endorsing that he/she is afraid to sleep away from home and does not like leaving his/her parents. However, avoidance or impairment as a result of his/her anxiety was denied by both {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parents. Although {{CHILD_NAME}} does not meet criteria for a clinical diagnosis, he/she may benefit from supportive counseling to continue employing coping strategies for anxiety and nervousness. This support will be especially important when {{CHILD_NAME}} transitions to a new school and adjusts to increased academic demands.
#### w/ ADHD Diagnosis
Regarding anxiety, {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parents endorsed some symptoms of worrying in the clinical interview and questionnaires. Similarly, clinical observations during the evaluation revealed that {{CHILD_NAME}} displays some anxiety related tendencies (e.g. asking a lot of questions of what is coming next, inquiring if his/her answers are correct, nervousness when timed, double checking directions). Furthermore, {{CHILD_NAME}} reported many somatic symptoms (i.e. body aches), which in the absence of a medical cause can be a manifestation of anxiety. Although these symptoms do not warrant a separate diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, individuals diagnosed with ADHD are at risk for increased anxiety, due to the frustration they experience in executing executive functioning skills. As such anxiety and somatic symptoms should be monitored by his/her parents. It is also important to note the role that anxiety plays in executive functioning, as anxiety is characterized by symptoms of diminished ability to think, psychomotor agitation and poor concentration, similar to symptoms that characterize ADHD. To the extent that these factors contribute to his/her ADHD symptoms, improvements in attention would be expected with effective management of his/her anxiety. School counseling and strategies to help {{CHILD_NAME}} recognize and regulate his/her emotions are provided below.
#### w/ ASD, previous GAD dx in 2015
With regard to anxiety, parental reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} has made much progress, and no longer presents with clinically significant symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (as was previously diagnosed in 2015). {{CHILD_NAME}}'s teacher however, did endorse significant concern regarding ongoing difficulty with anxiety in the classroom and somatic complaints. {{PARENT_NAME}} also endorsed sub-clinical anxiety related to separation fears and somatic symptoms. He/She also reported that {{CHILD_NAME}} does experience brief 'flare-ups', when he/she becomes more worried. Anxiety symptoms frequently co-occur in children with autism spectrum disorders, and some symptoms of anxiety can mimic behaviors commonly observed in children with ASD. Currently, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety does not appear to be in excess of anxiety symptoms typically observed in children with ASD. Therapeutic services to improve social skills, adaptability and develop emotional regulation skills are suggested below.
#### w/ASD, R/O Social Anxiety and Select Mutism
In addition, symptoms of anxiety were reported on parent questionnaires. Diagnostic interview with {{PARENT_NAME}} clarified that these symptoms are most severe in social settings (e.g., refusal to speak in large groups, performance settings, and when speaking to unfamiliar people). Given {{CHILD_NAME}}'s young age, it is difficult to determine the extent to which his/her symptoms are related to deficits in social skills (i.e., ASD, requiring confirmation) and/or an underlying anxiety disorder. Although an anxiety disorder diagnosis is not included below, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s behaviors should continue to be closely monitored and addressed within the context of psychotherapy and/or social skills groups. Furthermore, if these symptoms persist following intensive treatment for social skills difficulties and underdeveloped language, it is highly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} undergo a comprehensive evaluation to further clarify a potential diagnosis of Social Anxiety Disorder. Notably, a diagnosis of Selective Mutism was considered. However, this diagnosis cannot be given if refusal to speak occurs within the context of ASD. Thus, these symptoms can be reassessed after confirming {{CHILD_NAME}}'s diagnosis of autism.
#### w/ Gifted Child
Additionally, some mild anxiety symptoms were indicated by {{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} relating to worrying occasionally, and some nervousness surrounding separation from his/her parents. These symptoms did not meet criteria for diagnosis of an anxiety disorder upon further interview. Children, such as {{CHILD_NAME}}, who are gifted, can be at risk for difficulty regulating negative emotions and tolerating frustration. As such, he/she will benefit from strategies to cope with frustration. His/Her anxiety should be monitored to ensure that he/she continues to have good confidence in his/her abilities and symptoms do not worsen.
#### w/ Low Self-Esteem and no MH dx
These reports did not reveal any areas of significant clinical concern. Overall, {{CHILD_NAME}} is a compassionate and socially-adept young child with a positive attitude. His/Her parents did note some concern regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s tolerance of frustration, saying that he/she is internalizing his/her learning difficulty. Additionally, {{CHILD_NAME}} indicated some symptoms of anxiety and learning problems in his/her self-report questionnaires. Although his/her symptoms do not currently warrant a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s perception of his/her own anxiety and skills suggests that he/she is at-risk for developing low self-esteem regarding his/her academic skills. As such, it is crucial that he/she receive appropriate support in school to address his/her learning needs and improve his/her self-esteem. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s level of anxiety should continue to be monitored to determine if there is any change in presentation as academic demands increase.
#### Child Reports More Problems Than Parents
Of note, was that in {{CHILD_NAME}}'s self-report of his/her emotional functioning, he/she endorsed a range of panic and somatic symptoms (i.e. getting headaches and stomachaches in school, sweating and dizziness). {{CHILD_NAME}} further indicated significant problems with attention, learning, hyperactivity and aggression, which were not indicated to be problematic by his/her teacher or parent. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s perception of his/her own behavior and anxiety, suggests that he/she has internalized his/her past struggles in these domains and experiences residual low self-esteem regarding his/her behavior. As such, it is crucial that {{CHILD_NAME}} continue to receive appropriate therapeutic support to continue to manage his/her emotional regulation as well as interventions to improve his/her self-efficacy. Additionally, a high level of somatic symptoms in the absence of a medical cause can be a manifestation of anxiety. Thus, panic and somatic symptoms should be monitored by his/her parents and treatment team.
#### w/ ADHD and Gifted
Lastly, although significant symptoms of anxiety or worry were largely denied, {{CHILD_NAME}} does present with low self-esteem in conjunction with his/her performance in school and academic skills. Children with ADHD are at high-risk for anxiety and low self-esteem due to the frustration they experience in their effort to utilize executive skills. This is especially true in children with superior cognitive abilities, such as {{CHILD_NAME}}, who often have high expectations for performance. As such, it is crucial that {{CHILD_NAME}} receive appropriate support in school to address his/her executive functioning needs. His/Her parents may consider initiating counseling or therapy to help improve his/her self-efficacy and learn strategies to cope with frustration.
#### w/ Social Skills and Lang
Lastly, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parent and teacher both indicated some concern regarding symptoms of anxiety and low self-esteem. {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly can be hard on himself/herself and is sensitive regarding his/her social skills. In a self-report interview, {{CHILD_NAME}} similarly endorsed becoming nervous in connection to social and academic tasks in which he/she does not feel confident. Although {{CHILD_NAME}} does not meet criteria for a clinical diagnosis, children such as {{CHILD_NAME}}, with academic and language delays, are at high risk for anxiety and issues with self-esteem. As such, it is crucial that he/she receive proper academic support. {{PARENT_NAME}} may also consider initiating psychotherapy for {{CHILD_NAME}} to learn coping strategies for anxiety, as well as support to build his/her self-efficacy.
#### w/ Rigidity Not Assoc w/ ASD
{{PARENT_NAME}} noted that {{CHILD_NAME}}, at times, can be rigid in his/her thinking and often seeks preemptive information and reassurance from others. This dichotomous, or 'black and white', thinking can negatively impact the way people view themselves or situations. Subsequently, when expectations are not met, fear and anxiety can arise. Thus, it is strongly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} undergo cognitive behavioral therapy and/or skills-based parent programs to address his/her endorsed anxiety symptoms.
#### w/ SLD in Reading
##### anxious reading in class
{{CHILD_NAME}}, {{PARENT_NAME}} and his/her teacher reported mild concerns related to anxiety. {{CHILD_NAME}} reports that he/she is self-conscious of his/her academic performance and becomes anxious in class when asked to read in front of others. Children diagnosed with reading disorders are at risk for anxiety and frustration resulting from their deficits. When children start noticing that something is harder for them than the other kids, and that they are falling behind, they can understandably get anxious. The period before a learning disorder is diagnosed can be particularly stressful. As such, it is crucial that {{CHILD_NAME}} receive appropriate support for his/her reading and processing issues in order to bolster his/her confidence. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s level of anxiety should continue to be monitored to determine if there is any change in presentation as academic demands increase.
##### w/ ADHD, asking a lot of questions of what is coming next, inquiring if his/her answers are correct, hard on himself/herself, double checking directions
Regarding anxiety, {{CHILD_NAME}}, his/her teacher and his/her parent endorsed some concerns regarding anxiety, worrying and mild somatic symptoms. Similarly, clinical observations during the evaluation revealed that {{CHILD_NAME}} displays some anxiety related tendencies (e.g. asking a lot of questions of what is coming next, inquiring if his/her answers are correct, hard on himself/herself, double checking directions). Although these symptoms do not reach threshold for a separate diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s level of anxiety should continue to be monitored to determine if there is any change in presentation as academic demands increase. Individuals diagnosed with reading disorders and ADHD are at risk for increased anxiety, due to the frustration they experience in learning and executing executive functioning skills. When children start noticing that something is harder for them than their peers, and that they are falling behind, they can understandably get anxious. The period before a learning disorder is diagnosed can be particularly stressful. As such, it is crucial that {{CHILD_NAME}} receive appropriate support for his/her reading and processing issues in order to bolster his/her confidence. {{CHILD_NAME}} will also benefit from support to improve his/her emotional regulation skills and self-esteem (as described below).
## Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
### Initial Dx at HBN, no ADOS required
Based on results of the current evaluation, {{CHILD_NAME}} exhibits delays within the both of the major areas that can be associated with autism. Namely, {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly demonstrates significant delays in his/her social skills and nonverbal communication. Additionally, significant symptoms related to restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior were endorsed. Behavioral observations were consistent parental reports of autism symptoms. Considering his/her developmental history, a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder is warranted.  A qualifier of without accompanying intellectual and language impairment is appropriate in accordance with {{CHILD_NAME}}'s well developed cognitive and language functioning. Therapeutic services to improve social skills, improve adaptability and develop emotional regulation skills are recommended.
### Prior Diagnosis, confirmed by HBN
#### w/ accompanying language or intellectual impairment
Consistent with prior evaluation, current results indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} continues to meet criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder, based on the presence of core vulnerabilities and inconsistent skills in the domains of social interaction, language and communication, and repetitive behaviors/atypical interests. The specifier 'with accompanying language impairment' has been added to account for a longstanding history of speech and language deficits. [MD7][MD8] Therapeutic services to improve social skills, improve adaptability and develop emotional regulation skills are recommended.
#### w/ difficulty w/ social skills and nonverbal communication and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior
With regard to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), {{CHILD_NAME}} was reportedly assigned this diagnosis at age X years old, and the diagnosis was reportedly confirmed following an evaluation in MONTH YEAR at AGENCY. Based on results of the current evaluation, {{CHILD_NAME}} exhibits continued delays within both of the major areas that can be associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Namely, {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly demonstrates significant delays in his/her social skills and nonverbal communication. Additionally, symptoms related to restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior were endorsed, although to a lesser degree. Therapeutic services to improve social skills, improve adaptability and develop emotional regulation skills are recommended.
#### w/ associated language impairment
With regard to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), {{CHILD_NAME}} was reportedly assigned this diagnosis at age X years old. Based on results of the current evaluation, {{CHILD_NAME}} exhibits delays within the both of the major areas that can be associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Namely, {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly demonstrates significant delays in his/her social skills and nonverbal communication. Additionally, symptoms related to restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior were endorsed. Due to aforementioned language vulnerabilities, a qualifier of associated language impairment is also specified below. Therapeutic services to improve social skills, improve adaptability and develop emotional regulation skills are recommended.
#### w/ delays in both core areas
With regard to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), {{CHILD_NAME}} continues to exhibit delays within the both of the core areas that are associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Namely, {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly demonstrates significant delays in his/her social skills and nonverbal communication. Additionally, significant symptoms related to restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior were endorsed. Therapeutic services to improve social skills, improve adaptability and develop emotional regulation skills are recommended.
### confirmed prev. dx, ADOS Given at HBN
#### without associated language impairment
The ADOS-2, a semi-structured, standardized observation measure, was also administered. These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} continues to present with vulnerabilities and inconsistent skills within the major areas associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD);
* Social interaction and communication
* Restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviors
A qualifier of 'without associated language impairment' is specified below. Therapeutic services to improve social skills, improve adaptability and develop emotional regulation skills are recommended.
#### Previous Asperger's with accompanying language impairment
Consistent with previous diagnosis of Asperger's at age 7, current results indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} continues to meet criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder, based on the presence of core vulnerabilities and inconsistent skills in the domains of social interaction, language and communication, and stereotyped behaviors/atypical interests. The specifier 'with accompanying language impairment' is listed below to account for his high level of functioning in these domains. {{CHILD_NAME}} has reportedly made much progress in his social skills and emotional regulation and will continue to benefit from therapeutic services to improve social skills, adaptability and develop emotional regulation skills (see below).
#### Previous PDD-NOS
Regarding Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), {{CHILD_NAME}} was reportedly assigned a diagnosis of Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) at age XX.  The diagnosis of PDD-NOS has since been updated with the revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) to Autism Spectrum Disorder.  Based on results of the current evaluation, {{CHILD_NAME}} exhibits delays within the both of the major areas associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Namely, {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly demonstrates significant delays in his/her social skills and nonverbal communication. Additionally, symptoms related to restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior were endorsed.  As such, a diagnosis of ASD continues to be warranted at this time.
### Prior dx, further testing recommended
#### past asperger's dx in 2015
Consistent with his/her previous diagnosis of Asperger's following a neuropsychological evaluation in 2015, {{CHILD_NAME}} evidences mild vulnerabilities and inconsistent skills within the major areas associated with autism:
1) Social interaction and communication
2) Restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviors
The present evaluation is not comprehensive in determining diagnosis of an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). As the Asperger's diagnosis is not included in the DSM-5, an evaluation using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale ' II (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview ' Revised (ADI-R) can reinforce and clarify his/her established diagnosis of an Autism Spectrum Disorder and elucidate the most appropriate course of interventions to support social and academic performance.
#### past evaluations with differing conclusions and past PDD
With regard to autism related symptoms, {{CHILD_NAME}} has received several past evaluations which came to differing conclusions whether {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for a diagnosis. He/She was diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified at age X years old. {{PARENT_NAME}} reports that he/she believes the diagnosis may have been assigned based on unclear reports of {{CHILD_NAME}}'s developmental history. Results of the current evaluation reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} continues to evidence vulnerabilities and inconsistent skills within the social communication and interactions domain associated with autism spectrum disorders. Alternatively, a non-significant level of concern and impairment was reported with regards to restricted/repetitive behaviors which are also required for an Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis. The present evaluation is not comprehensive in determining a diagnosis of an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals like {{CHILD_NAME}}, who are affected by social anxiety and language delays. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation is recommended, using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale ' II (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview ' Revised (ADI-R), in order to clarify his/her previous diagnosis, as well as provide individualized treatment recommendations. This evaluation can also give consideration for a diagnosis of Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder (SCD), which is defined by primary difficulty with language pragmatics (i.e. the social use of language and communication) as manifested by deficits in understanding and following social rules of verbal and nonverbal communication in various contexts.
#### Reevaluation Needed (Young Age)
These reports also indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} continues to exhibit delays within both of the major areas that are associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Namely, {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly demonstrates delays in his/her social skills as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior. The present evaluation is not comprehensive in determining diagnosis of an ASD. Considering {{CHILD_NAME}} was diagnosed with autism at a very young age, an evaluation using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale ' II (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview ' Revised (ADI-R) is recommended to clarify his/her previous diagnosis and elucidate the most appropriate course of interventions to support social and academic performance. A comprehensive evaluation for autism can also differentiate between autistic traits which are better attributed to ADHD than Autism Spectrum Disorder; autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals affected by attention disorders. Specifically, children with ADHD are at a higher risk for rejection by their peers, due to poor social skills associated with behavior regulation difficulty and poor frustration tolerance (e.g., bossy, intrusive, inflexible, controlling, annoying, explosive, argumentative, inattentive during organized sports/games, and violating the rules of the game). Therapeutic services to improve social skills, improve adaptability and develop emotional regulation skills are recommended below.
#### By history, previous diagnosis
Results of the current evaluation indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} evidences vulnerabilities and inconsistent skills within  both the social communication and interactions  and restricted and repetitive behaviors domains associated with autism. The present evaluation is not comprehensive in determining a diagnosis of an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals like {{CHILD_NAME}}, who are affected by anxiety. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation is recommended, using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale ' II (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview ' Revised (ADI-R), in order to clarify his previous diagnosis, as well as provide individualized treatment recommendations. This evaluation can also give consideration for a diagnosis of Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder (SCD), which is defined by primary difficulty with language pragmatics (i.e., the social use of language and communication) as manifested by deficits in understanding and following social rules of verbal and nonverbal communication in various contexts. Although the current evaluation did not confirm, the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder is listed below by history, in order to reflect his/her previous diagnosis.
### Requires Confirmation
#### standard
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} evidences deficits within both of the areas associated with autism spectrum disorders:
1)	Social communication and interaction
2)	Restricted behaviors, atypical interests and activities
Considering early developmental history and reported impairment caused by these symptoms, a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is listed below. The diagnosis requires confirmation, as the present evaluation is not comprehensive in determining a diagnosis of ASD. An evaluation using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale ' II (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview ' Revised (ADI-R) can confirm his diagnosis and elucidate the most appropriate course of interventions to support social and academic performance. {{CHILD_NAME}} will require support for both social communication and restricted behaviors. A comprehensive evaluation for autism can also differentiate between autistic traits which are better attributed to ADHD than autism spectrum disorder; autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals affected by attention disorders. Specifically, children with ADHD are at a higher risk for rejection by their peers, due to poor social skills associated with behavior regulation difficulty and poor frustration tolerance (e.g., bossy, intrusive, inflexible, controlling, annoying, explosive, argumentative, inattentive during organized sports/games, and violating the rules of the game). As such, treatment of ADHD symptoms should improve {{CHILD_NAME}}'s social relationships. Additionally, it is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} participate in a social skills group (as described below). Therapeutic services to improve social skills, improve adaptability and develop emotional regulation skills are suggested below.
#### Previous PDD-NOS
Consistent with his/her previous reported diagnosis of PDD-NOS at age X, {{CHILD_NAME}} evidences vulnerabilities and inconsistent skills within both of the major areas associated with autism. Specifically, he/she struggles with social interactions including difficulty with reciprocal conversation, sharing interests and understanding nonliteral language. Several concerns were also noted regarding long-standing patterns of restricted and repetitive behavior patterns. {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrates extremely inflexible adherence to routines, uses overly scripted and stereotyped speech, hypersensitivity to certain textures of food. The diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder is listed below, requiring confirmation. The present evaluation is not comprehensive in determining diagnosis of an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). As the PDD-NOS diagnosis is not included in the DSM-5, an evaluation using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale ' II (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview ' Revised (ADI-R) can reinforce and clarify his/her diagnosis and elucidate the most appropriate course of interventions to support social and academic performance.
##### With Prosopagnosia and difficulties with word retrieval
{{PARENT_NAME}} also reported a longstanding history of difficulty with facial recognition for familial individuals (i.e., long-term family friends, teachers etc.) and word retrieval. Prosopagnosia and word-finding difficulties are frequently observed in children diagnosed with autism; however, a separate consultation is recommended with a neurologist and pediatrician to determine the most appropriate course of treatment specifically focusing on these challenges.
### ASD dx with associated symptoms
#### OCD symptoms/compulsive behaviors
##### w/ repetitive behaviors such as kissing a mezuzah and closing the door
{{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} also reported the presence of repetitive behaviors such as kissing a mezuzah and closing the door with the reported goal of reducing anxiety and preventing a dreaded event from happening (e.g. robbers coming into the house). {{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} further indicated that the behaviors cause mild family distress, but do not interfere with his/her functioning in any setting nor are the behaviors time-consuming. The presence of obsessions or recurrent intrusive thoughts, was denied. It is important to note that compulsive behavior can also be associated with the repetitive behaviors and rigidity found in children with ASD. Additionally, children with phobias often display behaviors with the purpose of reducing anxiety. At this time, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s compulsive behavior is most likely associated with ASD and other established anxiety disorders, rather than compulsions associated with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). It is critical that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s behaviors are monitored and that his/her anxiety is addressed in individual therapy.
##### documentation not available, w/ spinning, routes, tapping
{{CHILD_NAME}} was reportedly previously diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (documentation was not available for review). {{PARENT_NAME}} indicated the diagnosis was made based on symptoms of repetitive spinning of objects and adhering to strict routines and becoming upset if those routines were not followed (e.g., following the same route, tapping things a certain amount of times). These symptoms, as reported, were considered most consistent with repetitive behaviors and rigidity associated with ASD. Considering intrusive thoughts and distress resulting from these behaviors was denied, the current evaluation did not find evidence consistent with an OCD diagnosis.
### Rule out ASD
#### R/O w/ anxiety and language
{{CHILD_NAME}}'s mother reported  vulnerabilities and inconsistent skills within the major areas that can be associated with autism spectrum disorder in the interview and questionnaires. Namely, {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrates difficulty with social communication, social interactions, restricted interests, severe difficulty adapting to change and some sensitivities to sensory input. However, non-verbal communication deficits were denied. It is important to note autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals affected by anxiety and language delays. The current evaluation does not include a comprehensive evaluation of autism related symptoms and therefore the diagnosis cannot be definitively ruled out at this time. As such, an evaluation using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale ' II (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview ' Revised (ADI-R) is recommended to rule out a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder and elucidate the most appropriate course of interventions to support social and academic performance.
#### R/O w/ ADHD
##### recommended ADOS
These reports also indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} evidences vulnerabilities and inconsistent skills within the major areas associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):
1) Social interaction and communication
2) Restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviors
The present evaluation is not comprehensive in determining diagnosis of an ASD. As such, a rule-out diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder is assigned below and an evaluation using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale II (ADOS) can clarify his/her diagnosis and elucidate the most appropriate course of interventions to support social and academic performance. A comprehensive evaluation for autism can also differentiate between autistic traits which are better attributed to ADHD (see below) than autism spectrum disorder; autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals affected by attention disorders. Specifically, children with ADHD are at a higher risk for rejection by their peers, due to poor social skills associated with behavior regulation difficulty and poor frustration tolerance (e.g., bossy, intrusive, inflexible, controlling, annoying, explosive, argumentative, inattentive during organized sports/games, and violating the rules of the game). As such, treatment of ADHD symptoms should improve {{CHILD_NAME}}'s social relationships. Additionally, it is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} participate in a social skills group (as described below).
##### recommended ADOS and ADI-R
Finally, it is worth noting that the social vulnerabilities and restricted interests reported by {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parents and teachers do not necessarily indicate clinical concern for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations and have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals affected by ADHD. Specifically, children with ADHD are at a higher risk for rejection by their peers, due to poor social skills associated with behavior regulation difficulty and poor frustration tolerance (e.g., bossy, intrusive, inflexible, controlling, annoying, explosive, argumentative, inattentive during organized sports/games, and violating the rules of the game). As such, treatment of ADHD symptoms should improve his/her social relationships. Additionally, it is strongly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} continue to participate in a social skills group (as described below). However, the present evaluation is not comprehensive in determining a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). As such, an evaluation using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale ' II (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview ' Revised (ADI-R) can more effectively rule out a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder and elucidate the most appropriate course of interventions to support social and academic performance.
### Subthreshold ASD
#### Elevations on Questionnaires
It is also worth noting that the social vulnerabilities reported by {{PARENT_NAME}} on autism questionnaires (i.e., SCQ, GARS, SRS) do not indicate clinical concern for an autism spectrum disorder. Autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals affected by attention disorders. Specifically, children with ADHD are at a higher risk for rejection by their peers, due to poor social skills associated with behavior regulation difficulty and poor frustration tolerance (e.g., bossy, intrusive, inflexible, controlling, annoying, explosive, argumentative, inattentive during organized sports/games, and violating the rules of the game). As such, treatment of ADHD symptoms should improve his/her social relationships. Additionally, it is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} participate in a social skills group (as described below). There is no current indication for consideration of an ASD diagnosis.
#### w/ ADHD
##### ADOS recommended
These reports also indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} evidences vulnerabilities and inconsistent skills within the major areas associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):
1) Social interaction and communication
2) Restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviors
The present evaluation is not comprehensive in determining diagnosis of an ASD. As such, an evaluation using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale ' II (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview ' Revised (ADI-R) can clarify his/her diagnosis and elucidate the most appropriate course of interventions to support social and academic performance. A comprehensive evaluation for autism can also differentiate between autistic traits which are better attributed to ADHD than autism spectrum disorder; autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals affected by attention disorders. Specifically, children with ADHD are at a higher risk for rejection by their peers, due to poor social skills associated with behavior regulation difficulty and poor frustration tolerance (e.g., bossy, intrusive, inflexible, controlling, annoying, explosive, argumentative, inattentive during organized sports/games, and violating the rules of the game). As such, treatment of ADHD symptoms should improve {{CHILD_NAME}}'s social relationships. Additionally, it is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} participate in a social skills group (as described below).
##### no current indication of ASD
It is also worth noting that the social vulnerabilities reported by {{CHILD_NAME}}, his/her parent and teacher do not indicate clinical concern for an autism spectrum disorder. Autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals affected by attention disorders. Specifically, children with ADHD are at a higher risk for rejection by their peers, due to poor social skills associated with behavior regulation difficulty and poor frustration tolerance (e.g., bossy, intrusive, inflexible, controlling, annoying, explosive, argumentative, inattentive during organized sports/games, and violating the rules of the game). As such, treatment of ADHD symptoms should improve his/her social relationships. Additionally, it is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} participate in a social skills group (as described below). There is no current indication for consideration of an ASD diagnosis.
##### inconsistent evidence, specialized evaluation recommended
These reports also indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} evidences vulnerabilities and inconsistent skills within the major areas associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):
1) Social interaction and communication
2) Restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviors
Reports and behavior observations also indicated strengths which are inconsistent with ASD including appropriate social reciprocity and nonverbal communication. It is important to note that autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals affected by attention disorders. Specifically, children with ADHD are at a higher risk for rejection by their peers, due to poor social skills associated with behavior regulation difficulty and poor frustration tolerance (e.g., bossy, intrusive, inflexible, controlling, annoying, explosive, argumentative, inattentive during organized sports/games, and violating the rules of the game). As such, treatment of ADHD symptoms should improve his/her social relationships. Additionally, it is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} participate in a social skills group (as described below). Clinical impressions from the current evaluation indicate there is insufficient evidence for  consideration of an ASD diagnosis at this time. However, the present evaluation is not comprehensive in determining diagnosis of an ASD. As such, if symptoms related to ASD do not improve or intensify following treatment for ADHD, a more specialized evaluation for autism is recommended.
##### no current indication of ASD, occupational therapy and social skills coaching
{{PARENT_NAME}} expressed some concern regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s social communication and interaction skills, sensory sensitivities, inflexibility/rigidity, and history of underdeveloped motor skills. These behaviors are not captured by the current diagnoses nor do they indicate clinically significant concern for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at this time. Of note, autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals affected by ADHD. [CS9]Although there is no indication for consideration of an autism diagnosis at the present time, occupational therapy and social skills coaching may be considered in helping {{CHILD_NAME}} address his/her sensory sensitivities, enhance his/her social communication abilities, and better relate to peers.
#### Past Incorrect Dx with poor social communication in school and some sensory sensitivities
Lastly, with regard to {{CHILD_NAME}}'s previous diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder, the current evaluation did not find evidence warranting this diagnosis. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s previous diagnosis was reportedly based on his/her poor social communication in school and some sensory sensitivities. However, parental reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} has always displayed appropriate social skills and communication in contexts in which he/she is comfortable (i.e. with friends, family and some adults). His/Her poor communication is better accounted for by the diagnosis of selective mutism. {{CHILD_NAME}} did not display deficits in social interaction or relatedness during the early developmental period. Furthermore, other core symptoms of ASD were denied, including repetitive behavior patterns, restricted interests, and adherence to routines. As such, based on the results of this evaluation and the clinical impressions of the examiner, there is no indication for consideration of an autism diagnosis.
#### w/ IDD and Prev Dx
With regard to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), {{CHILD_NAME}} was reportedly assigned this diagnosis at a very young age, over the course of an early intervention evaluation that was not available during the current testing. Intellectual disability and ASD do frequently co-occur, although the DSM-5 notes that in order for an additional diagnosis of ASD to be appropriate, 'social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level.' Based on results of the current evaluation, {{CHILD_NAME}} exhibits inconsistent skills within the major areas that can be associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Namely, {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly displays some good social and play skills, however struggles with some aspects of social communication related to his/her general language delays. The current evaluation does not include a comprehensive evaluation of autism related symptoms and therefore the diagnosis cannot be definitively ruled out at this time. However, given available data, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s social communication is not below expectations considering his/her developmental level and thus an additional diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder does not appear to be warranted. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parents may consider a more specialized comprehensive evaluation of Autism to more effectively rule out this diagnosis (see below recommendations).
#### No Dx, referral from pediatrician
##### w/ deficits in social communication and interactions
Lastly, regarding autism, {{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}}'s pediatrician were interested in ruling out this diagnosis. Although {{CHILD_NAME}} displays deficits in his/her social communication and interactions, he/she does not demonstrate this difficulty across contexts. He/She also does not display other core symptoms of autism, including restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior. Furthermore, {{CHILD_NAME}} did not display deficits in social interaction or relatedness during the early developmental period.
##### w/ difficulty considering others' personal space
Lastly, regarding autism, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s pediatrician was interested in ruling out this diagnosis. Although {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly displays some difficulty considering others' personal space, no other significant deficits were reported or observed regarding his/her social relatedness, communication or interaction. Additionally, other core symptoms of autism, including restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior were not reported. Autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals affected by difficulty with emotional regulation and low frustration tolerance. There is no indication for consideration of an autism diagnosis at the present time.
#### w/ Anx and Low Frustration Tolerance
##### no indication of ASD
Lastly, mild deficits in social communication (e.g. misses out on some social cues) and restricted patterns of behavior were endorsed (e.g., rigidity, upset with changes in his/her routine). However, these mild autistic traits do not indicate clinical concern for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals affected by anxiety and low frustration tolerance. There is no indication for consideration of an autism diagnosis at the present time. However social skills coaching may be considered in helping {{CHILD_NAME}} develop his/her social communication abilities and better relate to peers.
##### further evaluation needed to r/o
Additionally, longstanding concerns were reported by {{PARENT_NAME}} regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s social communication as well as restricted patterns of behavior. {{CHILD_NAME}} has a history of difficulty with social-emotional reciprocity and understanding social conventions. However, at his/her current school, he/she reportedly shares close relationships with a small group, with whom he/she relates to very well. {{CHILD_NAME}} also has always reportedly displayed adherence to routines and rigidity in his/her schedule. While these deficits can be related to longstanding anxiety symptoms, it is important to note that social communication and restricted patterns of behavior are also core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. The current evaluation does not include a comprehensive evaluation of autism related symptoms and therefore the diagnosis cannot be definitively ruled out at this time. If {{CHILD_NAME}}'s social skills do not respond to appropriate treatment of his/her anxiety, his/her parents may consider further, more specialized evaluations, which can more effectively rule out autism.
#### w/ Anx and Language
##### no indication of ASD
Regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s social skills, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parent reports concerns for some behaviors and symptoms that can be associated with autism spectrum disorder. Namely, {{CHILD_NAME}} presents with difficulty making friends, preference to play alone, and poor eye contact. Observations during the testing indicate that eye contact is appropriate in a one to one setting. Notably, other core-symptoms of autism spectrum disorder were denied, including restricted interests, stereotyped speech, repetitive behaviors, sensory sensitivities and over adherence to routine. It is important to note that autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals affected by social anxiety. Clinical impressions resulting from the current evaluation suggest there is no indication for consideration of an autism diagnosis at the present time. In addition to psychotherapy, social skills coaching is strongly recommended to help {{CHILD_NAME}} develop his/her social communication abilities and better relate to peers.
##### further evaluation needed to r/o
Lastly, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parents report vulnerabilities and inconsistent skills within the major areas that can be associated with autism spectrum disorder. Namely, {{CHILD_NAME}} presented with past hand flapping, ongoing difficulty adapting to change and some sensitivities to sensory input. However, only mild difficulty was noted regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s social interactions; he/she reportedly is able to develop age appropriate friendships, however does struggle with some aspects of social communication related to his/her general language delays. Autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals affected by anxiety and language delays. The current evaluation does not include a comprehensive evaluation of autism related symptoms and therefore the diagnosis cannot be definitively ruled out at this time. If {{CHILD_NAME}}'s restricted behavior patterns and difficulty adapting to change do not respond to appropriate treatment of his/her anxiety, his/her parents may consider further, more specialized evaluations, which can more effectively rule out autism.
#### w/ Irritable Mood
Finally, it is worth noting that the social vulnerabilities and rigidity reported by {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parents does not necessarily indicate clinical concern for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations and have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals with depressive symptoms, especially irritability. Children with irritability and low frustration tolerance are at a higher risk for rejection by their peers, due to poor social skills associated with behavior regulation difficulty (e.g., bossy, intrusive, inflexible, controlling, annoying, explosive and violating the rules of the game). As such, treatment of mood symptoms should improve his/her social relationships. Additionally, it is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} participate in a social skills group (as described below).
#### w/ Language, Concerns Noted By Psych
The reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} is a friendly, positive and well- adjusted sweet young child. He/She is caring towards his/her peers and well mannered. Results of the questionnaires did not reveal any concerns related to internalizing or externalizing emotional or behavioral issues. However, past concerns were noted by a professional who worked with {{CHILD_NAME}} regarding possible symptoms of autism spectrum disorder including some difficulty interpreting social interactions, communicating clearly and self-stimulatory behavior. However, other core symptoms of ASD, relating to deficits in nonverbal communication, restricted patterns of behavior and inflexible adherence to routines were denied. Autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in children with language delays. Based on the results of this evaluation and the clinical impressions of the examiner, there is no indication for consideration of an autism diagnosis at the present time. However, speech therapy is recommended to help {{CHILD_NAME}} develop his/her pragmatic communication abilities and better relate to peers.
### Sensory/Motor Difficulties w/o ASD
{{PARENT_NAME}} expressed some concern regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s sensory sensitivities (e.g., ____) and underdeveloped motor skills (e.g., ____). Although these behaviors are not captured by the current diagnoses outlined below, these behaviors should continue to be closely monitored and could be addressed within the context of psychotherapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and/or social skills groups.
## Social (Pragmatic) Communication D/O
### standard
{{CHILD_NAME}} and {{PARENT_NAME}} completed the K-SADS semi-structured psychiatric interview for DSM-5 as well as several questionnaires related to emotional and behavioral function.
{{CHILD_NAME}} has a series of symptoms that pertain to oppositional behavior, inattention, and poor regard for some social norms in the context of significant hearing impairment that is requiring a cochlear implant in the near future. Regarding potential symptoms related to an Autism Spectrum diagnosis, {{PARENT_NAME}} reports that {{CHILD_NAME}} evidences vulnerabilities and inconsistent skills within the social interaction and communication domains. Other core symptoms of ASD, relating to restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviors, were denied. As such, a diagnosis of ASD is excluded based on results of this evaluation. However, consideration for a diagnosis of Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder (SCD) may be appropriate in characterizing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s impairments in social interaction and communication. SCD is defined by primary difficulty with language pragmatics (i.e. the social use of language and communication) as manifested by deficits in understanding and following social rules of verbal and nonverbal communication in various contexts. As the present evaluation is not comprehensive in determining a diagnosis of SCD, a more specialized evaluation may elucidate if a diagnosis of SCD is appropriate and guide the most appropriate course of interventions to support social development.
### R/O SCD
#### no diagnoses
These reports indicated mild concerns regarding attention and social skills but did not reveal any clinically significant concern warranting additional DSM-5 diagnoses. Regarding potential symptoms related to an Autism Spectrum diagnosis, {{PARENT_NAME}} reports that {{CHILD_NAME}} evidences vulnerabilities and inconsistent skills within the social interaction and communication domains; however, other core symptoms of ASD, relating to restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviors, were denied. Autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations, and actually have an increased frequency of occurrence in children with language delays. There is no indication for consideration of an autism diagnosis at the present time. However, continued social skills training is recommended to help {{CHILD_NAME}} develop his/her pragmatic communication abilities and better relate to peers.
#### w/ anxiety
Regarding potential symptoms related to an Autism Spectrum diagnosis, {{PARENT_NAME}} reports that {{CHILD_NAME}} evidences vulnerabilities and inconsistent skills within the social interaction and communication domains. Other core symptoms of ASD, relating to restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviors, were denied. As such, a diagnosis of ASD is not warranted based on results of this evaluation. Autistic traits occur in varying degrees in non-autistic populations and have an increased frequency of occurrence in individuals affected by anxiety. Additionally, children who are gifted intellectually may not share interests with same-aged peers. Social skills coaching may be considered in helping {{CHILD_NAME}} develop his/her social communication abilities and better relate to peers. If his/her social functioning does not improve with treatment of his/her anxiety, consideration for a diagnosis of Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder (SCD) may be appropriate in characterizing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s impairments in social interaction and communication. SCD is defined by primary difficulty with language pragmatics (i.e. the social use of language and communication) as manifested by deficits in understanding and following social rules of verbal and nonverbal communication in various contexts. As the present evaluation is not comprehensive in determining a diagnosis of SCD, a more specialized speech-language evaluation may elucidate if a diagnosis of SCD is appropriate and guide the most appropriate course of interventions to support social development.
#### R/O SCD w/in Prev PDD-NOS/ASD
Consistent with his/her previous diagnoses of PDD-NOS (MONTH YEAR; age X), {{CHILD_NAME}} continues to evidence vulnerabilities and inconsistent skills associated with autism spectrum disorder (i.e. deficits in social communication and interactions, adherence to routines, hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli). However, it is important to note that other core symptoms of autism pertaining to restricted and repetitive behaviors were denied. The present evaluation is not comprehensive in determining diagnosis of an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Thus, an evaluation using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale ' II (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview ' Revised (ADI-R) confirm and clarify his/her established diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder, as well as provide individualized treatment recommendations. This evaluation can also give consideration for a diagnosis of Social (pragmatic) Communication Disorder (SCD), which is defined by primary difficulty with language pragmatics (i.e. the social use of language and communication) as manifested by deficits in understanding and following social rules of verbal and nonverbal communication in various contexts.
### SCD Confirmed, Previous Dx
These reports were consistent with {{CHILD_NAME}}'s most recent diagnosis of Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder (SCD) rather than Autism Spectrum Disorder. {{CHILD_NAME}} continues to evidence vulnerabilities and inconsistent skills within the social interaction and communication domains. Other core symptoms of ASD, relating to restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviors, were not endorsed at a clinically significant level. SCD is defined by primary difficulty with language pragmatics (i.e. the social use of language and communication) as manifested by deficits in understanding and following social rules of verbal and nonverbal communication in various contexts. Social skills coaching may be considered in helping {{CHILD_NAME}} develop his/her social communication abilities and better relate to peers.
## Bipolar Disorder
### Bipolar Disorder II Current Episode Depressed, in Partial Remission
Parent and child report indicated a history of mood dysregulation as well, including past and current symptoms consistent with major depressive episodes. In addition to these episodes, {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent endorsed at least one episode consistent with prior Hypomania. The Hypomanic episode was considered to be of significant concern to warrant a diagnosis of Bipolar Affective Disorder Type II (Current Episode Depressed, in Partial Remission) over a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder. Environmental stressors and academic demands have likely contributed to symptom severity.
### Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder (Prozac and Abilify)
With regard to past mood symptoms, {{PARENT_NAME}} indicated a history of one episode of manic symptoms (e.g., persistently irritable mood, increased energy and goal-directed activity, rapid speech, racing thoughts) for approximately X days/weeks after {{CHILD_NAME}}'s doses of Prozac and Abilify were increased. These symptoms reportedly remitted within three days of these medications being replaced with Zoloft and Risperdal. According to {{PARENT_NAME}}, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms of mania caused significant impairment at home and at school when they were present. Therefore, he/she meets criteria for a diagnosis of medication-induced bipolar and related disorder. Although it appears likely that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms were precipitated by the change in his/her medication regime, he/she remains at-risk for future mood episodes, and his/her symptoms should be monitored closely by his/her care providers. In addition, psychotherapy and family psychoeducation regarding mood symptoms is recommended to address mood regulation concerns.
## Body Dysmorphic Disorder
### R/O or Sub-clinical Body Dysmorphic Disorder
{{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} endorsed frequent/occasional preoccupation of perceived flaws in {{CHILD_NAME}}'s physical appearance (i.e., large ears and forehead) and engaging in frequent/occasional repetitive behaviors (i.e., mirror checking and comparing himself/herself to others).  Although {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptomology meets criteria for a  diagnosis of Body Dysmorphic Disorder it is listed as a rule-out at this time as many of his/her symptoms may be better explained by {{CHILD_NAME}}'s perception of himself/herself and his/her concerns with other's perception of him/her.  {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parents should continue to monitor these symptoms and have him/her re-evaluated after addressing the underlying symptoms of anxiety.
## BPD: Borderline Personality Disorder
Personality disorders are not formally assessed with the measures used in this evaluation. However, clinical concern regarding personality development emerged in interviews, based on core patterns of mood instability, high-risk behaviors, substance use, unstable sense of self, suicidal ideation, and interpersonal conflict. Several traits that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences and manifests can be consistent with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The diagnosis is described in DSM-5 in the following way: 'A pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts.' Information obtained during the current evaluation clinically identified the following symptoms of BPD:
1. A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation.
2. Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.
3. Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats
4. Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days)
5. Chronic feelings of emptiness
As five criteria are required by DSM-5, a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder is assigned below as a presumptive diagnosis requiring confirmation over the course of future therapeutic treatment with {{CHILD_NAME}}. Treatment for BPD is recommended below with the goal of treating {{CHILD_NAME}}'s adaptive coping skills in an intensive and comprehensive manner.
Traits
{{CHILD_NAME}}'s exposures to trauma are an important factor in sculpting his/her approach to attachment and formation of his/her personality. Of note, personality disorders are not formally assessed with the measures used in this evaluation. However, clinical judgment based upon qualitative factors gleaned from {{CHILD_NAME}}'s own descriptions of his/her thoughts, feelings, and behavior, and evaluator observation of same, raises concern for the possibility of a Personality Disorder, specifically Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The diagnosis is described in DSM-5 in the following way:
A pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts.
Observations during the current evaluation suggested the following symptoms of BPD: instability regarding self-image/affect and marked impulsivity across settings. A diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder does not appear in the list below, but clinical observation and judgment suggests that further consideration should be given by professionals working with {{CHILD_NAME}} to facilitate ongoing evaluation of and monitoring for a personality disorder.
## Conduct Disorder
### Conduct Disorder, Childhood-onset type
In addition, a number of behavioral concerns were endorsed for {{CHILD_NAME}} during the clinical interview. {{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} endorsed X/15 frequent disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct-concerning behaviors (e.g., ____) for {{CHILD_NAME}} since the age of _____. [CS12]These reports are consistent with endorsements on the CBCL, Conners, and TRF. Given the level of impairment in {{CHILD_NAME}}'s academic/social functioning these behaviors cause across settings, a diagnosis of Conduct Disorder, ______-onset type, is warranted. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct-concerning behaviors can be addressed in a variety of treatment modalities, including Parent and Behavioral Management Training, as outlined below.
### Conduct Disorder, Adolescent-onset type
#### standard
In addition, a number of behavioral concerns were endorsed for {{CHILD_NAME}} during the clinical interview. {{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} endorsed X/15 frequent disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct-concerning behaviors (e.g., ____) for {{CHILD_NAME}} since the age of _____. [CS12]These reports are consistent with endorsements on the CBCL, Conners, and TRF. Given the level of impairment in {{CHILD_NAME}}'s academic/social functioning these behaviors cause across settings, a diagnosis of Conduct Disorder, ______-onset type, is warranted. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct-concerning behaviors can be addressed in a variety of treatment modalities, including Parent and Behavioral Management Training, as outlined below.
#### adolescent onset w depression and ODD behaviors
In conjunction with irritability, {{CHILD_NAME}} is very often argumentative, blames others for his/her mistakes and is angry and resentful. He/She also exhibits infrequent temper outbursts in which he/she has become aggressive toward others. Although {{CHILD_NAME}}'s irritability, temper outbursts, and defiant behaviors meet criteria for Oppositional Defiant Disorder, this diagnosis is not assigned when behaviors occur within the context of depression. {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly displayed a depressed affect from a very young age. However, {{CHILD_NAME}} does meet criteria for a diagnosis of Conduct Disorder (adolescent onset), due to a reported pattern of physically aggressive and destructive behaviors, lying and bullying of others. {{CHILD_NAME}} is aware of the negative impact of his/her actions on others but does not express remorse according to {{PARENT_NAME}}.
### Conduct Disorder, Unspecified-onset type
In addition, a number of behavioral concerns were endorsed for {{CHILD_NAME}} during the clinical interview. {{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} endorsed X/15 frequent disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct-concerning behaviors (e.g., ____) for {{CHILD_NAME}} since the age of _____. [CS12]These reports are consistent with endorsements on the CBCL, Conners, and TRF. Given the level of impairment in {{CHILD_NAME}}'s academic/social functioning these behaviors cause across settings, a diagnosis of Conduct Disorder, ______-onset type, is warranted. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct-concerning behaviors can be addressed in a variety of treatment modalities, including Parent and Behavioral Management Training, as outlined below.
### Subthreshold
#### w impulsivity
In addition, a number of behavioral concerns were endorsed for {{CHILD_NAME}} during the clinical interview. Within the past X-X years, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s rule-breaking behaviors have increased in severity to include occasional symptoms of Conduct Disorder (e.g., ____). These behaviors may be exacerbated by impulsivity and do not meet full criteria for a diagnosis of Conduct Disorder. It is essential that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms be monitored closely and treated accordingly.
#### w/ lying, missing class, stealing
{{PARENT_NAME}} further indicated recent increased instances of conduct-related behaviors, including lying, missing classes and past incidents of stealing. Although he/she does not currently meet criteria for a diagnosis of Conduct Disorder, it is crucial that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s behavior be monitored by his/her current therapist to ensure his/her conduct symptoms do not become more prevalent.
## Eating Disorders
### Anorexia Nervosa
#### Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting type
{{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} reported that {{CHILD_NAME}} has been restricting his/her energy intake (e.g., _____), due to fears of gaining weight or becoming fat and resulting in a significantly low body weight. Binge-eating behaviors were denied. As such, full criteria are met for Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting type. It is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s eating habits be monitored by medical professionals (e.g., primary care physician) and addressed in the context of therapy with mental health clinicians.
#### Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-eating/purging type
{{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} reported that {{CHILD_NAME}} has been restricting his/her food intake (e.g., _____), due to fears of gaining weight or becoming fat and resulting in a significantly low body weight. Restricting behaviors were denied. As such, full criteria are met for Anorexia Nervosa, Restricting type. It is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s eating habits be monitored by medical professionals (e.g., primary care physician) and addressed in the context of therapy with mental health clinicians.
#### Binge-Eating Disorder
{{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} reported that {{CHILD_NAME}} engages in recurrent binge eating episodes associated with eating much more rapidly than normal, eating until feeling uncomfortably full, eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry, eating alone due to embarrassment, feeling disgusting/depressed/guilty afterward. Considering associated distress, full criteria are met for Binge-Eating Disorder. It is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s eating habits be monitored by medical professionals (e.g., primary care physician) and addressed in the context of therapy with mental health clinicians.
#### Subthreshold w/ ADHD and ASD
Lastly, concerns were noted regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s history of binge eating habits when he/she is not closely monitored. Individuals with ASD and ADHD are at an increased risk of developing impulsive eating patterns. They may have difficulty interpreting their body's cues and are vulnerable to interpreting feeling upset (or bored) for feeling hungry. As such it is important that {{CHILD_NAME}} receive support if needed from a nutritionist who specializes in behavioral cues for eating.
#### Past subthreshold "binge eating" w/ ADHD diagnosis
Past concerns were noted regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s history of eating habits, specifically eating until feeling uncomfortably full and at a more rapid pace with minimal awareness of his/her internal hunger cues; however, criteria for binge eating disorder was not met as the amount of food consumed in each discreet period was not objectively 'in excess' of what is than what most individuals would consume under similar circumstances. It is important to consider that individuals with ADHD are at an increased risk of developing impulsive eating patterns.'They may have difficulty interpreting their body's cues and are vulnerable to interpreting feeling upset (or bored) for feeling hungry. Should the aforementioned/maladaptive eating patterns resurface, it may be appropriate for {{CHILD_NAME}} to work with a nutritionist who specializes in behavioral cues for eating.'
### Bulimia Nervosa
{{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} reported that {{CHILD_NAME}} has been engaging in recurrent binge eating episodes (e.g., _____) and inappropriate behaviors to prevent weight gain (e.g., _____), occurring at least once per week for 3 months. As such, full criteria are met for Bulimia Nervosa. It is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s eating habits be monitored by medical professionals (e.g., primary care physician) and addressed in the context of therapy with mental health clinicians.
### Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder
Furthermore, {{CHILD_NAME}} and {{PARENT_NAME}} report that {{CHILD_NAME}} began to engage in restrictive eating habits due to fears of gaining weight (e.g., trying to limit to one meal per day) in X. Since that time, {{CHILD_NAME}} reported engaging in several instances of binging and purging.  At the time of the interview, {{CHILD_NAME}} denied symptoms occurring at least once per week for 3 months. As such, full criteria were not met for bulimia nervosa. A diagnosis of Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder is appropriate to account for reported binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors that are of low frequency and limited duration. It is strongly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s eating habits be monitored by medical professionals (e.g., primary care physician) and addressed in the context of therapy with mental health clinicians.
## Enuresis/Encopresis
### Enuresis
#### Nocturnal only
Lastly, {{PARENT_NAME}} reports that {{CHILD_NAME}} is not yet toilet trained at night and experiences nocturnal enuresis nightly. As such, a diagnosis of Enuresis, nocturnal only is warranted. Behavioral interventions for treating bedwetting include strategies such as scheduling mid-night wake-ups, reward systems for dry nights, retention control training to enlarge bladder capacity (bladder training), bedwetting alarms and fluid restriction. Medication intervention to decrease urine production can also be considered. {{PARENT_NAME}} should consult with {{CHILD_NAME}}'s pediatrician in order to monitor symptoms and intervention progress.
##### once per week, improvement from past
Lastly, {{PARENT_NAME}} reports that {{CHILD_NAME}} currently experiences nocturnal enuresis about once per week. Although this represents an improvement from the past, these accidents are distressing for {{CHILD_NAME}} and indicate a diagnosis of Enuresis, nocturnal only. The frequency of his/her accidents reportedly is associated with his/her stress level. Behavioral interventions for treating bedwetting include strategies such as scheduling mid-night wake-ups, reward systems for dry nights, retention control training to enlarge bladder capacity (bladder training), bedwetting alarms and fluid restriction. Medication intervention to decrease urine production can also be re-considered. {{PARENT_NAME}} should consult with {{CHILD_NAME}}'s pediatrician in order to monitor symptoms and intervention progress.
##### once to twice per week, improvement from past
{{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences nocturnal enuresis about 1-2x per week. {{PARENT_NAME}} indicated that the enuresis is moderately distressing for {{CHILD_NAME}}. The frequency of current accidents indicates a diagnosis of Enuresis, nocturnal only. {{PARENT_NAME}} reported recent improvement using behavioral intervention (i.e. schedule mid-night wake-ups). Other behavioral interventions for treating bedwetting include strategies such as reward systems for dry nights, retention control training to enlarge bladder capacity (bladder training), bedwetting alarms and fluid restriction. Medication intervention to decrease urine production can also be re-considered. {{PARENT_NAME}} should continue to consult with {{CHILD_NAME}}'s pediatrician in order to monitor symptoms and intervention progress.
#### Nocturnal and Diurnal
##### standard
{{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly  voids his/her bladder into his/her bed and clothing (insert frequency) during the daytime/nighttime [CS13]hours. Thus, these symptoms meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for a diagnosis of Enuresis. Behavioral strategies (e.g., bell and pad, terminating fluid intake, prompting to use the restroom during the day/night) may be considered.
##### once per week
Lastly, {{PARENT_NAME}} reports that {{CHILD_NAME}} has minor toileting accidents about once per week. The frequency of current accidents indicates a diagnosis of Enuresis, nocturnal and diurnal. Based on {{CHILD_NAME}}'s age, symptoms should be monitored to determine whether severity changes over time.
#### Diurnal w/ Selective Mutism
{{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed that {{CHILD_NAME}} has daytime enuresis on a regular basis (2-3x per week), since he/she was in kindergarten. The accidents primarily occur in school. Enuresis is more common in children with a history of Selective Mutism, in part due to shyness regarding asking to go to the bathroom. The frequency of current accidents indicates a diagnosis of Enuresis, diurnal only. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parents should consult with his/her pediatrician to rule out a medical cause. Behavioral techniques can be explored in individual therapy and recommendations for school are provided below.
#### Past Enuresis
##### Nocturnal,
{{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for a past diagnosis of Nocturnal Enuresis, based on the historical frequency of bedwetting accidents. {{PARENT_NAME}} reported that from age X-X, {{CHILD_NAME}} had bedwetting accidents most nights of the week. Symptoms have been improving within the past two years and should continue to be monitored.
##### Nocturnal, current subclinical
Lastly, {{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed that {{CHILD_NAME}} has a history of nocturnal enuresis. Currently the accidents do not meet criteria for a diagnosis. If frequency increases, behavioral interventions for treating bedwetting include strategies such as reward systems for dry nights, retention control training to enlarge bladder capacity (bladder training), bedwetting alarms and fluid restriction. Consultation with {{CHILD_NAME}}'s pediatrician is recommended to rule out medical causes and to continue to monitor symptoms and intervention progress.
#### Subthreshold Enuresis- Diurnal
{{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences frequent/occasional/infrequent diurnal enuresis (i.e., occurs ____ time(s) per day/week/month).  Currently the wetting accidents do not meet criteria for a diagnosis of Enuresis. If the frequency increases, behavioral interventions include strategies such as reward systems for dry days.  Consultation with {{CHILD_NAME}}'s pediatrician is recommended to rule out any medical causes and to continue to monitor his/her symptoms and intervention progress.
### Encopresis
#### standard
Historically and currently, {{CHILD_NAME}} has soiling accidents (at insert frequency) with/without constipation and overflow incontinence[CS14]. Thus, these symptoms meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for a diagnosis of Encopresis. Behavioral strategies (e.g., prompting to use the restroom) may be considered, and {{CHILD_NAME}}'s pediatrician should be consulted regarding treatment for constipation[AR15].
#### Rule Out
##### encopresis only
Finally, {{PARENT_NAME}} reported ongoing soiling accidents at varying frequency. A rule-out diagnosis of Encopresis is listed below and follow up evaluation with {{CHILD_NAME}}'s pediatrician is recommended to rule out a medical cause.
#####  w/ enuresis
Finally, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parents reported ongoing toileting accidents at a frequency warranting a diagnosis of Enuresis and Encopresis. These diagnoses are listed as rule-outs and should be monitored as {{PARENT_NAME}} is in the process of determining a possible medical cause for his/her incontinence.
## Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder
### standard
{{PARENT_NAME}} also endorsed symptoms of excoriation (Skin-Picking) for {{CHILD_NAME}}. Specifically, he/she recurrently picks skin on his/her fingers/toes/hands resulting in skin lesions, particularly when he/she is anxious or stressed[CS16], across various settings (i.e., at home, in school). He/She will briefly stop when asked by others but will shortly re-engage in this behavior. As such he/she meets criteria for a diagnosis of Excoriation Disorder. {{CHILD_NAME}} will likely benefit from Habit Reversal Training (HRT), a behavioral therapy that helps reduce repetitive behaviors (i.e., skin picking) by teaching children and their parents skills to help notice the signs/urge that a repetitive behavior is starting and to prevent these behaviors.
### w/ tics
{{PARENT_NAME}} indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} displays anxiety related picking of his/her skin which leads to scabbing and welts. As such he/she meets criteria for a diagnosis of Excoriation Disorder. This could also be addressed, along with tics, through habit reversal training (described below).
### subthreshold/Mild w/ GAD, R/O OCD
Lastly, mild concerns were endorsed by {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent relating to obsessive and compulsive behavior tendencies. {{PARENT_NAME}} reports past skin- picking behavior which has largely subsided. Skin picking can be triggered by anxiety or stress and provide individuals with a feeling of relief. Additionally, {{CHILD_NAME}} endorsed mild compulsive organizational tendencies which serve the purpose of keeping himself calm. Although there was not sufficient evidence to warrant diagnosis of excoriation disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), these symptoms should be closely monitored in treatment, due to his/her increased risk associated with GAD.
## Gender Dysphoria/Gender Identity
### standard resources for gender identity
Individuals with an incongruence between expressed gender (gender identity) and assigned gender (biological sex), may experience a myriad of risks and challenges. [RN17]Resources for support are provided below.
### Gender Dysphoria dx
{{CHILD_NAME}} indicated significant distress associated with the feeling his/her body does not match his/her expressed gender/gender identity.  He/She reported a strong desire to remove her primary sex characteristics (i.e., engages in binding) and he/she wants to be treated consistent with his/her expressed gender/gender identity.  [MA18]These symptoms are reported to impact {{CHILD_NAME}}'s functioning at home and with friends.  Considering the frequency of symptoms, and level of distress and impairment {{CHILD_NAME}} meets DSM-5 criteria for Gender Dysphoria.  Gender Dysphoria can cause significant distress and dysfunction due to an individual's incongruence between their expressed gender (gender identity) and assigned gender (biological sex).  As a result, individuals may experience a myriad of risks and challenges, and mental health issues, including increased rates of depression, anxiety, suicide, irritability, oppositional defiance, aggression, and behavioral issues (conduct disorder).  Mental health issues may be reduced by providing appropriate supports and resources.
## IED: Intermittent Explosive Disorder
### w/ family history of mood disorders
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} is a sociable and cheerful child, who struggles to regulate his/her behavior and emotions in the home. At age X, {{CHILD_NAME}} began to exhibit explosive temper outbursts, in which he/she threatened suicidal behavior. {{CHILD_NAME}} becomes verbally and physically aggressive during the outbursts, which can be intense. {{CHILD_NAME}} is remorseful following the incidents and is reportedly upset at himself/herself for losing control of his/her emotions. Due to the severity and frequency of {{CHILD_NAME}}'s outbursts, criteria are met for a DSM-5 diagnosis of Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED). Considering {{CHILD_NAME}}'s emotional outbursts do not occur within the context of chronic irritability, a mood disorder diagnosis is not indicated. Temper outbursts are common in children who have low tolerance for frustration and have not developed adequate coping skills. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s behavior and emotional regulation significantly improved in response to psychotherapeutic interventions including Dialectical Behavior Therapy and parent management training. Considering his/her family psychiatric history of mood disorders, continued treatment and close monitoring are recommended in improving {{CHILD_NAME}}'s coping skills and tolerance for frustration.
### w/ ADHD
{{CHILD_NAME}} exhibits explosive temper outbursts in school, in which he/she is aggressive towards adults and poses a safety risk to his/her peers. Due to the severity and frequency of {{CHILD_NAME}}'s outbursts at school, criteria are met for Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED). As such, in addition to the previously mentioned structured classroom setting and behavioral support at school, {{CHILD_NAME}} requires behaviorally-based psycho-therapeutic treatment to improve his/her tolerance for frustration and learn adaptive coping skills. Children with ADHD often have difficulty regulating negative emotions and tolerating frustration, and experience improvements in these areas when primary ADHD symptoms are treated. If temper outbursts do not improve following treatment of ADHD, considerations for psychopharmacological treatment of outbursts is provided below.
## Mood Disorders (MDD, DMDD, SI)
### Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)
#### standard
In addition, a number of behavioral and emotional concerns were endorsed for {{CHILD_NAME}} during the clinical interview. {{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences developmentally inappropriate temper outbursts (e.g., ____), occurring at least 3 times per week since age ____. [CS19]In between these outbursts, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s mood is observed to be persistently irritable/angry for most of the day for several days at a time. These symptoms have been present for at least 1 year across multiple settings (e.g., ____) and cause impairment in {{CHILD_NAME}}'s functioning at home, in school, and during extracurricular activities. Thus, full criteria are met for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s emotional and behavioral difficulties can be addressed in a variety of treatment modalities, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as well as Parent and Behavioral Management Training.
#### w/ ADHD
{{PARENT_NAME}} additionally endorsed significant concerns regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s mood and temper. Specifically, he/she reported that since approximately age X, {{CHILD_NAME}} displays persistent boredom, irritability and sadness. Furthermore he/she also displays frequent intense outbursts (2-3x/week), in which he/she is verbally aggressive and on occasion physically aggressive. His/Her mood and outbursts reportedly interfere and disrupt his/her functioning in school, at home and socially. As such, a diagnosis of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) is appropriate in characterizing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms. Although {{CHILD_NAME}}'s irritability, temper outbursts, and defiant behaviors meet criteria for Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), when these disorders co-occur, a diagnosis of DMDD is given in lieu of ODD. It is important to note that it is common for children diagnosed with ADHD to display difficulty regulating behavior, negative emotions and tolerating frustration, and usually experience improvements in these areas when primary ADHD symptoms are addressed. Symptoms warranting diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder or a major depressive episode were denied. Recommendations for psychotherapeutic treatment, both privately and in school, are recommended below. The focus of treatment should be on helping {{CHILD_NAME}} develop strategies to improve his/her frustration tolerance and employ adaptive coping skills.
#### R/O DMDD w/ IDD and ADHD
{{CHILD_NAME}}'s outbursts have recently intensified, following a period of relatively calm mood during the summer months. He/She has a history of aggressive and violent behavior toward his/her classmates and {{PARENT_NAME}}, which has resulted in hospitalization. However, {{PARENT_NAME}} indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s mood between explosive outbursts is calm and even. Considering the reported absence of inter-episode irritability, {{CHILD_NAME}} does not currently meet criteria for a diagnosis of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD). It is important to note that temper outbursts, impulsivity and difficulty with emotional regulation are common in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability. Children with these developmental disabilities often lack an understanding of emotions, flexible thought processes, the adaptive skills necessary to cope with their emotions, and the social communication skills to more productively convey frustration and negative feelings. Additionally, children with ADHD may lack the executive functioning skills necessary to regulate and control their behavior. The combination of these disorders likely makes it extremely difficult for {{CHILD_NAME}} to regulate his/her behavior. He/She requires continued intensive psychotherapeutic support in order to learn adaptive coping strategies and provide support to manage his/her behavior, as well as ensure his/her safety and the safety of the people around him/her.
#### w/ ODD bxes
Further, {{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed several frequent symptoms of oppositionality and defiance (e.g., talks back, feels angry, retaliates) for {{CHILD_NAME}} across settings. As per the DSM-5, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder cannot be assigned in the presence of DMDD. As such, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s oppositionality and defiance are likely related to his/her difficulties with regulating his/her mood and behavior. Nonetheless, these concerns can be addressed in a variety of treatment modalities, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) as well as behavioral and emotional regulation strategies outlined below.
### Double Depression (MDD and PDD)
#### standard
Symptoms of depression for {{CHILD_NAME}} were reported on the CBCL, TRF, MFQ and YSR. The clinical interview indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences X/9 frequent symptoms of depression, including depressed mood and/or loss of interest/pleasure. Given the level of distress and impairment these symptoms cause {{CHILD_NAME}} across settings, full criteria for Major Depressive Disorder are met. The symptoms of depression also meet criteria for Persistent Depressive Disorder. This diagnosis, previously referred to as dysthymia, reflects {{CHILD_NAME}}'s longstanding history (since early childhood) of depressed and irritable mood and symptoms of insomnia, low energy, poor concentration, low self-esteem and feelings of hopelessness. These symptoms have been present without a period of two-month remission and have caused significant impairment at school, home and in social contexts. Psychotherapy and and psychopharmacological consultation may be helpful in addressing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s depressive symptoms and in augmenting his/her repertoire of adaptive and coping strategies.
#### Past
Although no significant concerns were noted regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s current mood, reports indicate {{CHILD_NAME}} experienced past significant elevations in depressive symptomatology. Specifically, {{CHILD_NAME}} reported two separate periods, one 18 months long in high school and the other 7 months long in college, in which he experienced clinically significant symptoms of depression. Given the level of distress and impairment these symptoms caused across settings, full criteria is met for Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episodes, with full remission of symptoms. Furthermore, the symptoms of depression also previously met criteria for Persistent Depressive Disorder. This diagnosis, previously referred to as dysthymia, reflects {{CHILD_NAME}}'s report of an 18-month period of depressed mood with low energy, poor concentration and low self-esteem. These symptoms were present without a period of two-month remission and caused significant impairment at school, home and in social contexts.
### MDD: Major Depressive Disorder
#### Mild
##### Single Episode
In addition, symptoms of depression for {{CHILD_NAME}} were reported on the CBCL, TRF, MFQ, YSR, and CSSS. The clinical interview indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences X/9 frequent symptoms of depression, including depressed mood and/or loss of interest/pleasure. Given the level of distress and impairment these symptoms cause {{CHILD_NAME}} across settings, full criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, single episode (mild) are met. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful in addressing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s depressive symptoms and in augmenting his/her repertoire of adaptive behavioral activation and coping strategies.
##### Recurrent
In addition, symptoms of depression for {{CHILD_NAME}} were reported on the CBCL, TRF, MFQ, YSR, and CSSS. The clinical interview indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences X/9 frequent symptoms of depression, including depressed mood and/or loss of interest/pleasure. Given the level of distress and impairment these symptoms cause {{CHILD_NAME}} across settings, full criteria for Major Depressive Disorder with recurrent episodes (mild) are met. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful in addressing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s depressive symptoms and in augmenting his/her repertoire of adaptive behavioral activation and coping strategies.
#### Moderate
##### Single Episode
In addition, symptoms of depression for {{CHILD_NAME}} were reported on the CBCL, TRF, MFQ, YSR, and CSSS. The clinical interview indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences X/9 frequent symptoms of depression, including depressed mood and/or loss of interest/pleasure. Given the level of distress and impairment these symptoms cause {{CHILD_NAME}} across settings, full criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, single episode (moderate) are met. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful in addressing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s depressive symptoms and in augmenting his/her repertoire of adaptive behavioral activation and coping strategies.
##### Recurrent
In addition, symptoms of depression for {{CHILD_NAME}} were reported on the CBCL, TRF, MFQ, YSR, and CSSS. The clinical interview indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences X/9 frequent symptoms of depression, including depressed mood and/or loss of interest/pleasure. Given the level of distress and impairment these symptoms cause {{CHILD_NAME}} across settings, full criteria for Major Depressive Disorder with recurrent episodes (moderate) are met. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful in addressing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s depressive symptoms and in augmenting his/her repertoire of adaptive behavioral activation and coping strategies.
#### Severe
##### Single Episode
In addition, symptoms of depression for {{CHILD_NAME}} were reported on the CBCL, TRF, MFQ, YSR, and CSSS. The clinical interview indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences X/9 frequent symptoms of depression, including depressed mood and/or loss of interest/pleasure. Given the level of distress and impairment these symptoms cause {{CHILD_NAME}} across settings, full criteria for Major Depressive Disorder, single episode (severe) are met. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful in addressing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s depressive symptoms and in augmenting his/her repertoire of adaptive behavioral activation and coping strategies.
##### Recurrent
In addition, symptoms of depression for {{CHILD_NAME}} were reported on the CBCL, TRF, MFQ, YSR, and CSSS. The clinical interview indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences X/9 frequent symptoms of depression, including depressed mood and/or loss of interest/pleasure. Given the level of distress and impairment these symptoms cause {{CHILD_NAME}} across settings, full criteria for Major Depressive Disorder with recurrent episodes (severe) are met. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful in addressing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s depressive symptoms and in augmenting his/her repertoire of adaptive behavioral activation and coping strategies.
#### With psychotic features, Single Episode
The present evaluation found that symptoms of depression meet criteria for a Major Depressive Disorder. The specifier 'with psychotic features' has been added to account for ongoing visual and auditory disturbances that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences every day. Given that the onset of the major depressive episode with psychotic features coincided temporarily taking MEDICATION, which may have antidepressant properties, destabilization of an underlying bipolar spectrum disorder vulnerability should be considered. Irrespective of the exact etiology, intensive treatment is recommended as soon as possible, including both psychotherapy and psychopharmacological components (as detailed below). Further monitoring and reevaluation of this diagnosis is essential over time to determine if there is any change in presentation.
#### In partial remission
##### Single Episode
###### standard
Regarding depressive symptoms, {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent confirmed a depressive episode in YEAR, in which {{CHILD_NAME}} displayed a persistently sad mood for about X months, with associated suicidal ideation, irritability, anhedonia, fatigue, decreased self-esteem and psychomotor agitation. Since that period of time, {{CHILD_NAME}} has continued to have occasional suicidal ideation intermittently, but denied symptoms constituting another depressive episode. As such, a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, in partial remission is appropriate. Continued monitoring of depression during the course of future interventions is recommended.
###### improved w/ psychotherapeutic treatment
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} is an insightful young man/woman who has made much progress with respect to anxious and depressive symptomology. {{CHILD_NAME}} has a prior diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) pertaining to a X-month episode, when {{CHILD_NAME}} was X years old. Since subsequently receiving psychotherapeutic treatment, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s mood and depression have significantly improved. However, reports indicate he/she continues to display symptoms of withdrawal from activities and irritability which interfere in his/her functioning. As such, a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, in partial remission (moderate) is appropriate. Continued monitoring of depression during the course of future interventions is recommended.
##### Recurrent
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} presents with symptoms of depression that meet criteria for a Major Depressive Disorder (MDD, severity: severe) with recurrent episodes. A qualifier of 'in partial remission' has been given, based on current symptom presentation (recently depressed mood does not usually last for the majority of the day). {{CHILD_NAME}}'s episodes of predominantly sad mood reportedly began around age X, with long periods of remission (usually during summer).
#### In full remission
##### Single Episode
###### w/ social stress and teasing from peers
Although they did not indicate any current concerns, both {{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} indicated that when {{CHILD_NAME}} was in X grade, there was a X month period in which {{CHILD_NAME}} displayed several symptoms of depression including persistent irritability, self-harm, decreased appetite, insomnia, psychomotor retardation, fatigue, decreased self-esteem, difficulty concentrating and indecisiveness. The symptoms were reportedly precipitated by social stress and teasing from peers. Considering reported symptom severity and interference in his/her academic, familial and social functioning, a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, is appropriate with full remission of symptoms. Considering {{CHILD_NAME}}'s family history of depression and past episode, he/she may benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy (described below) as a proactive treatment to learn coping skills and prevent recurrence of symptoms.
###### w/ prior diagnosis
The current evaluation results revealed past depression symptoms sufficient for a prior Major Depressive Episode, consistent with {{CHILD_NAME}}'s prior diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). However, there was no evidence to support a current Major Depressive Episode and, as such, a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, with full remission of symptoms was applied.
### Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)
#### standard
These reports indicate significant elevations in depressive symptomatology, meeting criteria for a diagnosis of Persistent Depressive Disorder. This diagnosis, previously referred to as dysthymia, reflects {{CHILD_NAME}}'s longstanding and persistent symptoms of depressed and irritable mood, frequently feeling bored and symptoms of poor concentration and low self-esteem. These symptoms have caused significant impairment at school, home and in social contexts. Given information presented during this evaluation, symptom intensity was not met for Major Depressive Disorder.
#### w/ school-related bullying
The present evaluation found that both {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent report significant elevations in depressive symptomatology. The symptoms of depression meet criteria for Persistent Depressive Disorder. This diagnosis, previously referred to as dysthymia, reflects {{CHILD_NAME}}'s longstanding history (since early childhood) of depressed and irritable mood and symptoms of insomnia, low energy, poor concentration, low self-esteem and feelings of hopelessness. These symptoms have been present without a period of two-month remission and have caused significant impairment at school, home and in social contexts. It seems possible that school-related bullying may have been a significant triggering factor.
Given information presented during this evaluation, symptom intensity and duration criteria were not met for Major Depressive Disorder.
#### Past Depressive Sxes - no dx
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} is currently a well-adjusted young child/adolescent with appropriate regulation of his/her behavior and his/her emotions. He/She presents as mature for his/her age and is motivated to perform well in school. Although they did not indicate any current concerns regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s mental health, both {{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} indicated that when {{CHILD_NAME}} was X years old he/she struggled to cope with teasing by peers. Although his/her reported symptoms of depression did not warrant diagnosis of a past depressive episode, {{CHILD_NAME}} may benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy (described below) as a proactive treatment to learn coping skills and prevent remission of symptoms in future times of stress.
#### Past, w/ ASD
{{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} is currently well adjusted and does not display persistent depressive symptoms. However, {{CHILD_NAME}} endorsed a past period in which he/she did feel more depressed, worthless and engaged in self-injurious behavior. Although this period did not meet criteria for a major depressive episode, depressive symptoms are common in individuals with autism spectrum disorders, due to lack of understanding of emotions and adaptive skills necessary to cope with them, as well as the social communication skills to convey frustration and negative feelings. Furthermore, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s profound impairments in processing speed likely directly impair his/her ability to flexibly process information in a timely manner. This could further impart risk in employing coping strategies. As such, psychotherapy is suggested in order to address adaptive coping strategies for dealing with anxiety and sadness. Exposure and response prevention techniques are also suggested below in order to address anxiety and difficulty initiating social interactions.
### Other Specified Depressive Disorder
#### standard
Parental report indicates that {{CHILD_NAME}} is a bright and very vocal child who is currently struggling to stay motivated and engaged in school. {{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed longstanding symptoms of irritability and boredom for {{CHILD_NAME}}, which have been precipitated by stress. {{CHILD_NAME}} seems to internalize stressful events in his/her environment and displays poor coping skills for tolerating frustration. {{PARENT_NAME}} did not endorse current or past depressive symptoms at a severity level warranting a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder or Persistent Depressive Disorder. His/Her current medication regimen to treat his/her mood symptoms is reportedly effective. Considering reported impairment caused by irritability, as well as concerns regarding his/her frustration tolerance and anger, a diagnosis of Other Specified Depressive Disorder is appropriate. It is strongly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} undergo psychotherapeutic treatment to address his/her emotional regulation skills, improve his/her self-esteem and teach him/her how to adaptively cope with frustration. Therapy with a family component is also suggested to provide strategies for addressing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s behavior within the home.
#### w/ Anx
Alternatively, in {{CHILD_NAME}}'s self-report of his/her emotional functioning, he/she endorsed a higher degree of both anxious and depressive symptoms, including frequent irritability and anhedonia. Regarding anxiety, he/she reported frequently worrying about world events and his/her family, as well as social anxiety, with associated panic symptoms in performance situations or when meeting new people. Considering {{CHILD_NAME}}'s reports of distress caused by anxiety and irritability, as well as his/her parents' concerns regarding his/her frustration tolerance and anger, diagnoses of Other Specified Anxiety Disorder and Other Specified Depressive Disorder are appropriate. It is strongly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} undergo psychotherapeutic treatment to address his/her emotional regulation skills, improve his/her self-esteem and teach him/her how to adaptively cope with frustration. It is also important to consider {{CHILD_NAME}}'s difficulty with articulation as a contributing factor to his/her reported anxiety regarding speaking in front of others. Speech therapy to improve his/her articulation will likely also help him/her gain self-confidence in these situations. Therapy with a family component is also suggested to improve interpersonal dynamics that may be contributing to his/her symptoms.
#### Rule-Out/Subthreshold
##### standard
Finally, {{CHILD_NAME}} exhibits various and impairing symptoms related to depressed mood. Although these issues do not warrant an additional diagnostic assignment, if not provided with effective intervention, {{CHILD_NAME}} is at-risk for developing increased symptoms that may meet diagnostic criteria for a mood disorder in the near future.
##### w/ withdrawal from social interaction and infrequent emotional outbursts
Concerns regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s mood were endorsed by {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parent. Although they both denied depression symptoms warranting a diagnosis of Persistent Depressive Disorder (i.e. dysthymia) or Major Depressive Disorder, concerns were noted by {{PARENT_NAME}} regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s increasing withdrawal from social interaction and infrequent emotional outbursts. He/She also is less attentive to his/her appearance and hygiene. {{CHILD_NAME}} should be monitored by his/her treating psychologist for any further changes in his/her behavior that could indicate worsening mood symptoms (e.g. further withdrawal from friends and family, changes in appetite or sleep, disconnect from reality or disorganized thoughts, further deteriorating hygiene, worsening temper outburst intensity or frequency, suicide thoughts, etc.)
##### w/ Anxiety
Individuals with anxiety disorders also have increased risks for the development of mood disorders. The present evaluation found evidence of subclinical patterns of depressive symptomatology, however the severity and consistency were not sufficient to warrant a diagnosis at the present time.
##### w/ ASD
While the present evaluation found evidence of subclinical patterns of depressive symptomatology (i.e. low self-esteem, excessive guilt, thoughts of death), the severity and consistency were not sufficient to warrant a diagnosis at the present time. However, continued monitoring of depression during the course of future interventions is recommended. {{PARENT_NAME}} reported that during outbursts, {{CHILD_NAME}} occasionally expresses suicidal ideation without specific plans or attempts. If {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences thoughts of wanting to harm his/herself in the future, please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency medical facility immediately.
##### w/ ADHD
###### current
A range of depression and withdrawal symptoms were also noted by {{CHILD_NAME}}'s teacher and parent. {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly spends significantly less time socializing then he/she did in the past and appears bored and uninterested in most activities. Children with ADHD also have increased risks for the development of mood disorders. While the present evaluation found evidence of patterns of depressive symptomatology, the severity and consistency were not sufficient to warrant a diagnosis at the present time. Nevertheless, it is highly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} participate in a cognitive behavioral therapy with behavior activation (described below).
###### past
Regarding mood, {{CHILD_NAME}} and {{PARENT_NAME}} did not indicate any significant current concerns. However, when {{CHILD_NAME}} was in X grade, they both indicated a time period lasting about X months, in which {{CHILD_NAME}} displayed low self-esteem, was more irritable than usual and he/she felt like he/she was 'in a slump.' The symptoms were reportedly precipitated by difficulty in academics and a poor fit in his/her school environment. Considering his/her mild symptom severity, diagnosis of a past depressive episode is not warranted. Nevertheless, children with ADHD have increased risk for the development of mood disorders and difficulties with adjustment. As such, it is important to monitor mood symptoms and seek appropriate therapeutic treatment if necessary.
## No Diagnosis
### no concern
#### standard
{{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} completed the K-SADS semi-structured psychiatric interview for DSM-5 as well as several questionnaires related to emotional and behavioral function. The results of these reports did not reveal any areas of clinical concern for {{CHILD_NAME}}.
#### well-adjusted, balances school with extracurricular activities, adaptable, copes well with disappointment, well developed social skills
These reports did not reveal any areas of significant clinical concern. Overall, {{CHILD_NAME}} is a well-adjusted young child/adolescent who has many interests and balances school achievement with his/her extracurricular activities. He/She is reportedly adaptable and copes well with disappointment. He/She demonstrates well developed social skills and shares good relationships with his/her peers and family.
#### creative and confident with a strong and independent personality
The results of the testing from {{CHILD_NAME}}'s participation in the Healthy Brain Network at the Child Mind Institute did not reveal any areas of clinical concern. {{CHILD_NAME}} presents as creative and confident young man/woman with a strong and independent personality. He/She shares close relationships with his/her family and friends.
#### follow-up with care provider
The results of the testing from {{CHILD_NAME}}'s participation in the Healthy Brain Network at the Child Mind Institute did not reveal any areas of clinical concern. If current concerns are not being addressed or new concerns are developed about {{CHILD_NAME}}, it is encouraged that his/her care-provider be contacted directly.  Upon request, our HBN team can also offer a list of providers that can address such difficulties. We are grateful for your participation in this project.
### Inconsistent Reports
Due to challenges in consistent reporting between {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her family, the complicated symptom profile, and inability to access informants outside of the home such as the school, diagnoses are being withheld at this time pending further longitudinal assessment and evaluation by a clinical behavioral health team. It is highly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} continue to be consistently provided with outpatient mental health treatment at _______. [CS20]In addition, it is strongly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} and {{PARENT_NAME}} participate in continued evaluation to be provided with more clarification about psychiatric risk-factors and current and potential symptom presentation.
### Subthreshold Symptoms
{{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} completed the K-SADS semi-structured psychiatric interview for DSM-5 as well as several questionnaires related to emotional and behavioral function. These reports indicated subthreshold elevations in symptoms of _________. Of note, these symptoms are below the frequency and severity level for a clinical diagnosis. Brief description of non-clinical concerns (e.g., ____.) A brief course of psychotherapy may be beneficial in improving {{CHILD_NAME}}'s coping skills for environmental stressors.
#### subthreshold anxiety
Results from {{CHILD_NAME}}'s participation in the Healthy Brain Network at the Child Mind Institute did not reveal any areas significantly impairing clinical concern. However, results demonstrate that {{CHILD_NAME}} exhibits subthreshold symptoms related to various forms of anxiety, including but not limited to worries related to _______. Although these symptoms and issues do not warrant a research-based psychiatric diagnosis, these difficulties are concerning, impede {{CHILD_NAME}} from meeting his/her potential across academic and non-academic settings, and require clinical attention. Thus, it is imperative that he/she be provided with an intervention that supports his/her ability to more adequately manage his/her emotions, increases his/her self-worth, fosters his/her tolerance for frustration and perceived difficulties, and develops his/her coping skills.
#### subthreshold anxiety with academic demands
These reports did not reveal any areas of significant clinical concern. Overall {{CHILD_NAME}} is a well-adjusted young child/adolescent who has many interests and balances school achievement with his/her extracurricular activities. Regarding anxiety symptoms, {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent both indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} can become overwhelmed with his/her commitments and displays signs of stress. Significant impairment as a result of his/her anxiety was denied. Although {{CHILD_NAME}} does not meet criteria for a clinical diagnosis, he/she may benefit from psychotherapy to continue employing coping strategies for anxiety and managing stress. This support will be especially important when {{CHILD_NAME}} transitions to a new school and adjusts to increased academic demands.
## OCD: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
### Confirmed Diagnosis
#### standard
{{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} endorsed {{CHILD_NAME}} has been experiencing obsessions (e.g., ______) and/or compulsions (e.g., ______), which {{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} find to be distressing and time-consuming (e.g., _____). {{CHILD_NAME}} believes his/her beliefs are likely not true/believes his/her beliefs are likely true/is convinced these beliefs are true. [CS21]As such full criteria are met for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. To address these symptoms, it is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} seek Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), specifically with a clinician skilled at providing Exposure Response Prevention (ERP), as explained below.
#### w/ physical health and social taboo obsessions, current Zoloft treatment
The present evaluation found that both {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent endorsed that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences obsessive and intrusive thoughts regarding his physical health and social taboos as well as compulsions (i.e., giving himself tests and mentally scanning his body), which {{CHILD_NAME}} finds to be distressing, time-consuming and interferes with his functioning. As such full criteria are met for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. {{CHILD_NAME}} and {{PARENT_NAME}} noted that his symptoms have improved with meditation and therapeutic strategies as well as starting Zoloft. To address these symptoms, it is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} continue to seek therapy including the evidence-based approaches outlined below.
#### w/ good to fair insight
{{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parents endorsed longstanding concerns regarding compulsive behaviors and rituals which {{CHILD_NAME}} performs within the home and at school. {{CHILD_NAME}} denied that these behaviors are distressing or cause impairment but did state that obsessive thoughts and compulsions take up a significant portion of his/her day and thoughts. His/Her reported symptoms meet criteria for a diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), with good to fair insight. Psychotherapeutic treatment for OCD is recommended as described below.
#### w/ hand washing, door checking, hand wringing
Concerns were endorsed by {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent relating to obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. Considering impairment (i.e. skin irritation) resulting from hand washing and increasing extensive behaviors (e.g checking doors, hand wringing), his/her symptoms warrant diagnosis of Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder (OCD), with good insight. Psychotherapeutic treatment for OCD is described below.
### Confirmed Previous dx
#### fear of hurting others, having to do actions a certain amount of times, improved w/ medication
{{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} reported a history of intrusive, distressing and recurrent obsessions (e.g., fear of hurting others, having to do actions a certain amount of times) that extend beyond the endorsed free-floating worries captured by a GAD diagnosis. Additionally, {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly attempted to suppress these thoughts and neutralize them with specific compulsive actions (e.g., having to turn a certain way, eat a certain number of a food, repeating an action a certain amount of times, not stepping on cracks). His/Her reported symptoms meet criteria for a diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), with good or fair insight. {{PARENT_NAME}} reports that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s obsessive thoughts and compulsions have subsided since MONTH YEAR, when he/she began taking MEDICATION.
#### w/ ASD
{{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} reported a history of intrusive, distressing and recurrent obsessions and compulsions that extend beyond the rigidity and repetitive behaviors captured by an ASD diagnosis. {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly attempts to suppress these thoughts and neutralize them with specific compulsive actions. Although level of severity has improved since initiation of psychopharmacological treatment, his/her reported symptoms continue to meet criteria for a diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), with good insight. Recommendations for treatment are provided below.
### Hoarding Disorder
{{PARENT_NAME}} additionally indicated concerns regarding compulsive hoarding behavior for {{CHILD_NAME}}; since a young age, {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly displays great difficulty discarding items (e.g. candy wrappers, old drawings) and becomes distressed when asked to throw these items away. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s room is reportedly very cluttered and disorganized as a result, which is a source of great tension in the family. Given the impairment and distress caused by his/her symptoms, a diagnosis of Hoarding Disorder is appropriate. Treatment for hoarding using CBT is recommended below. Additionally, {{CHILD_NAME}} endorsed the presence of occasional obsessive thoughts regarding wanting things to look a certain way. He/She denied however that these thoughts and behaviors take a significant amount of time, serve the purpose of reducing anxiety or cause disturbance in his/her functioning. Nevertheless, considering {{CHILD_NAME}}'s anxiety, it is important that these symptoms related to obsessive thoughts be monitored and addressed proactively in therapy.
### Past Diagnosis (in remission) related to allergies
Additionally, {{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} reported a past period of time (MONTH YEAR TO MONTH YEAR), in which {{CHILD_NAME}} experienced obsessive thoughts and engaged in compulsive actions, associated with dirt and contamination. They both explained that these thoughts were an outgrowth of severe allergies. His/Her reported symptoms met criteria for a diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), with good insight. This diagnosis is listed below as a past diagnosis, as the symptoms are reportedly in full remission. Children, such as {{CHILD_NAME}}, who are intellectually gifted, can be at risk for obsessive and compulsive behavior associated with perfectionism and high expectations. His/Her parents may consider initiating school counseling or cognitive behavior therapy to help improve his/her support seeking behavior and learn strategies to cope with frustration.
### Other Specified OCRD
{{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed {{CHILD_NAME}} presents with obsessive and compulsive behavior tendencies including obsessive thoughts about having playdates and compulsive checking behavior, inquiring when events will start or end.  Based on the current evaluation, these symptoms do not currently meet full criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder and can better be accounted for by generalized anxiety. However, it is important that these symptoms be monitored closely in treatment considering his increased vulnerability associated with history of rigidity and anxiety. {{PARENT_NAME}} also reports repetitive finger and toe-nail biting which can cause bleeding. Due to the reported associated distress and impairment caused both by checking behaviors and nail-biting, a diagnosis of Other Specified Obsessive- Compulsive and Related Disorder is warranted.
### Rule Out OCD/Subthreshold
#### obsessions w/ cleaniness and safety, door checking, washing dishes
Additionally, {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent endorsed the recent presence of recurrent obsessions pertaining to cleanliness and safety, as well as some compulsive repetitive behavior (i.e. checking windows and doors are locked, re-washing dishes) which is reportedly aimed at preventing anxiety and distress. However, they denied that the obsessions and compulsions are time-consuming or are currently impairing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s functioning. As such, he/she does not meet criteria for a diagnosis of an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Nevertheless, it is important that these symptoms be addressed proactively in therapy.
#### intrusive aggressive thoughts
Additionally, {{CHILD_NAME}} endorsed the presence of obsessive and intrusive thoughts regarding disgusting images he/she has seen, as well as aggressive thoughts of wanting to stab something. {{CHILD_NAME}} denied any associated compulsive behaviors and further denied that the thoughts are time-consuming or interfering in his/her functioning.

##### w/ other anxiety disorders
{{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} also reported the presence of repetitive behaviors such as ___ with the reported goal of reducing anxiety and preventing a dreaded event from happening (e.g. ____). {{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} further indicated that the behaviors cause mild family distress, but do not interfere with his/her functioning in any setting nor are the behaviors time-consuming. The presence of obsessions or recurrent intrusive thoughts, was denied. It is important to note that compulsive behavior can also be associated with the repetitive behaviors and rigidity found in children with ASD. Additionally, children with phobias often display behaviors with the purpose of reducing anxiety. At this time, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s compulsive behavior is most likely associated with ASD and other established anxiety disorders, rather than compulsions associated with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). It is critical that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s behaviors are monitored and that his/her anxiety is addressed in individual therapy.
##### previous incorrect diagnosis
{{CHILD_NAME}} was reportedly previously diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (documentation was not available for review). {{PARENT_NAME}} indicated the diagnosis was made based on symptoms of repetitive spinning of objects and adhering to strict routines and becoming upset if those routines were not followed (e.g., following the same route, tapping things a certain amount of times). These symptoms, as reported, were considered most consistent with repetitive behaviors and rigidity associated with ASD. Considering intrusive thoughts and distress resulting from these behaviors was denied, the current evaluation did not find evidence consistent with an OCD diagnosis.
#### w/ GAD and ADHD
{{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed that {{CHILD_NAME}} displays some symptoms related to obsessions and compulsions. Currently, the frequency, impairment and intensity of these symptoms has not met clinical threshold. Nevertheless, considering his/her diagnoses of GAD and ADHD, he/she is at high-risk for developing OCD in the future, and these symptoms need to be closely monitored. It is important that these symptoms be addressed proactively in therapy.
#### w/ GAD and current psychotherapy treatment
{{CHILD_NAME}} also reportedly displays symptoms related to obsessions and compulsions. Currently, the frequency, impairment and intensity of these symptoms has not met clinical threshold.

#### Monitor for Conduct
Significant oppositional and defiant behavior was reported by {{PARENT_NAME}}, starting at a young age (X oppositional symptoms). Given the frequency, impairment and severity of these symptoms a diagnosis of Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) is warranted. As {{CHILD_NAME}} only displays these behaviors in the home setting, a 'mild' qualifier is given. {{PARENT_NAME}} further indicated the presence of more severe conduct behaviors, beginning in the month prior to the evaluation (MONTH YEAR). {{CHILD_NAME}}'s behavior should be monitored by his/her current therapist to rule out a diagnosis of Conduct Disorder in the future. {{PARENT_NAME}} indicates that {{CHILD_NAME}} displays aggressive temper outbursts that are triggered by unpreferred requests or can happen seemingly out of nowhere. The outbursts, occurring once every couple of weeks, can result in personal harm, aggression and damage to material objects. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s outbursts do not occur at a frequency warranting a diagnosis of Intermittent Explosive Disorder. As {{CHILD_NAME}}'s outbursts do not occur in the context of chronic irritable mood, criteria are also not met for a diagnosis of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder.
#### w/ Anxiety and SLD
{{PARENT_NAME}} also endorsed longstanding concerns regarding emotional outbursts and oppositional behavior for {{CHILD_NAME}} within the home. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s behavior was reportedly exacerbated by stress resulting from his/her parent's divorce and difficulties with adjustment. Although he/she is well behaved at school, he/she is frequently argumentative and defiant at home, which has caused significant interference in family functioning. Considering his/her behavior at home, {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for a diagnosis of Oppositional Defiant Disorder. A qualifier of mild is appropriate due to the limited severity and range of his/her symptoms. It is important to note that it is common for children diagnosed with an anxiety disorder to display difficulty regulating behavior, negative emotions and tolerating frustration. Furthermore, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s aforementioned learning disorder in reading likely imposes increased demands on {{CHILD_NAME}} in school, which may exhaust his/her coping resources by the time he/she gets home. Children who have difficulty expressing their thoughts and emotions adaptively, often express their frustration through outbursts and acting out. {{CHILD_NAME}} responds well to structured environments.

Several treatment options are recommended below to target his/her symptoms in this domain.
### Moderate
#### w/ ADHD
##### at home and school, w/ unresponsive behavior
Additionally, reports from {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parents and school indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} exhibits oppositional behaviors at home and at school, as well as daily temper outbursts at home.

### Subthreshold outbursts and oppositional behavior
#### at home
In addition, a number of behavioral concerns were endorsed for {{CHILD_NAME}} during the clinical interview. {{PARENT_NAME}} reported occasional externalizing symptoms, including temper outbursts and argumentative behaviors, which occur mainly within the context of frustration at home. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s behaviors do not reach the level of severity to warrant a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. Additionally, his/her emotional outbursts do not occur within the context of chronic irritability, and a mood disorder diagnosis is therefore not indicated at this time. [CS23]The above behaviors can be addressed in the context of weekly individual psychotherapy to develop frustration tolerance and better coping skills.
#### at home and school w/ anxiety
{{PARENT_NAME}} also expressed concerns regarding frequent temper outbursts and oppositional symptoms in the home and school settings. These behaviors are reported to occur mainly within the context of frustration and disappointment. Currently, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s disruptive behaviors do not reach the level of severity to warrant a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder.

Improvements in temper outbursts should be expected with effective treatment of his/her underlying anxiety disorder.
#### w/ attentional weaknesses
{{PARENT_NAME}} also identified concerns about {{CHILD_NAME}}'s frustration tolerance and negative behavior (e.g., ______). These behaviors may be exacerbated by impulsivity and do not meet full criteria for a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. Externalizing behaviors are common in children with attentional weaknesses, as these children often lack the adaptive and attentional skills necessary to cope with frustration. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s ongoing[JA24] psychotherapy sessions can focus on improving his/her coping skills in the context of environmental stressors. Per parent report, {{CHILD_NAME}} has responded[JA25] well to behavioral interventions at school this year (e.g., sticker charts and specific praise for helping staff members). This positive response to behavioral support was also observed during the current evaluation. Additional strategies for reinforcing appropriate behavior are outlined below.
#### w/ ADHD
##### worse at home
Regarding mood and oppositional behavior, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parents and teachers endorsed concerns regarding frequent argumentative behavior and low tolerance for frustration (more acutely in the home). These behaviors are reported to occur mainly within the context of frustration and disappointment. As his/her emotional outbursts do not occur within the context of chronic irritability, a mood disorder diagnosis is not indicated at this time. Individuals diagnosed with ADHD are at risk for increased difficulty with emotional and behavioral regulation, due to the frustration they experience in executing executive functioning skills. Impairments in executive functions likely directly impair his/her impulse control and ability to flexibly process information in a timely manner. Outbursts may serve as a child's only means of communicating frustration or negative feelings. Improvements in oppositional behavior and frustration tolerance should be expected with effective treatment of ADHD. Additionally, {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parents will benefit from psychotherapeutic treatment to improve his/her emotional and behavior regulation skills (as described below).
##### at home and school, difficulty with time limits and transitions
Additionally, {{PARENT_NAME}} indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} has a history of temper outbursts and oppositional behavior within the home and at school.

As his/her emotional outbursts do not occur within the context of chronic irritability, a mood disorder diagnosis is not indicated at this time. His/Her oppositional behavior also did not meet threshold for diagnosis of a disruptive or conduct-related disorder. Nevertheless, individuals diagnosed with ADHD are at risk for increased difficulty with emotional and behavioral regulation, due to the frustration they experience in executing executive functioning skills. Improvements in emotional outbursts and oppositional behavior should be expected with effective treatment of ADHD (as described below). {{CHILD_NAME}} will require behavioral support to reinforce positive behaviors and provide are common in children who experience significant anxiety, when they have not developed coping skills for managing worry or frustration. Often treatment of the anxiety is sufficient to substantially decrease emotional outbursts. Several treatment options are recommended below to improve {{CHILD_NAME}}'s coping skills and tolerance for frustration.
#### w/ Anxiety
{{PARENT_NAME}} further indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} has exhibited temper outbursts in the home since he/she was a toddler. These behaviors reportedly occur mainly within the context of poor frustration tolerance. {{CHILD_NAME}} is remorseful following the incidents and is reportedly upset at his/herself for losing control of his/her emotions.

Temper outbursts are common in children who experience significant anxiety, when they have not developed coping skills for managing worry or frustration. Often treatment of the anxiety is sufficient to substantially decrease emotional outbursts. Several treatment options are recommended below to improve {{CHILD_NAME}}'s coping skills and tolerance for frustration.
#### w/ Anxiety and Language
Although {{CHILD_NAME}} has always been well behaved at school, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parents indicated concerns regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s history of displaying temper outbursts and being argumentative in the home. These behaviors reportedly occur mainly within the context of poor frustration tolerance (e.g., losing, not getting his/her way) or changes in his/her routine. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s emotional outbursts do not occur within the context of chronic irritability, and a mood disorder diagnosis is therefore not indicated at this time. Temper outbursts are common in children with anxiety as well as speech and language difficulty.

Often treatment of the anxiety and learning coping skills is sufficient to substantially decrease emotional outbursts and oppositional behavior. Several treatment options are recommended below to improve {{CHILD_NAME}}'s coping skills and tolerance for frustration.
#### w/ ASD
{{PARENT_NAME}} also endorsed that {{CHILD_NAME}} has ongoing difficulty regulating his/her emotions, often resulting in temper outbursts. Although outbursts have reportedly become milder in nature, the episodes continue to occur frequently. Emotional outbursts are common in children with autism spectrum disorders, as they often lack an understanding of emotions and the adaptive skills necessary to cope with them, as well as the social communication skills to convey frustration. Emotional outbursts may therefore serve as a child's only means of communicating negative feelings. Significant behavioral issues in the classroom were denied, suggesting that {{CHILD_NAME}} benefits from highly structured environments in controlling his/her emotions. As chronic irritability was denied, a diagnosis of a mood disorder (i.e. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder) is not warranted at this time.
#### w/ ASD and ADHD
##### improved
Lastly, {{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed concerns regarding increased argumentativeness and continued mild temper outbursts within the home. Currently, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s disruptive behaviors do not reach the level of severity to warrant a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. Additionally, his/her emotional outbursts do not occur within the context of chronic irritability, and a mood disorder diagnosis is therefore not indicated at this time. Emotional outbursts are common in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders. Children with autism spectrum disorders often lack an understanding of emotions and the adaptive skills necessary to cope with them, as well as the social communication skills to convey frustration and negative feelings. Furthermore, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s profound impairments in executive functioning likely directly impair his/her impulse control and his/her ability to flexibly process information in a timely manner. This could further impart risk in easy frustration and agitation. Significant behavioral issues in the classroom were denied, suggesting that {{CHILD_NAME}} benefits from highly structured environments in controlling his/her emotions and behavior. Improvements in outbursts should be expected with effective treatment of his/her underlying ADHD and ASD.

Additionally, as chronic irritability was denied, a diagnosis of a mood disorder (i.e. Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder) is not warranted at this time.
#### w/ Mood Disorder
##### w/ irritible mood
Additionally, {{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed that from a young age, {{CHILD_NAME}} has been argumentative and defiant in the home, which has caused significant interference in family functioning. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s behavior at school is more variable, depending on the fit with his/her teacher or environment. Considering his/her oppositional behavior occurs in the context of frustration and aforementioned irritable mood, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder is not warranted. {{CHILD_NAME}} responds well to structured environments in which he/she receives support. Behavior regulation techniques and therapy are recommended below for home and school (i.e. parent management training and functional behavior assessment).
##### w/ depressed mood
In addition, {{CHILD_NAME}} reportedly displays significant oppositional behavior, however a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder was rejected due to his/her behavior occurring within the context of a depressive mood disorder.
#### w/ OCD
Concerns were also endorsed regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s behavior and emotional regulation. He/She is reportedly very well behaved in school however, he/she displays increasing irritability and frustration at home. {{CHILD_NAME}} endorsed significant anxiety in questionnaires, but not at a level warranting diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Children diagnosed with OCD and anxiety symptoms are at high risk for irritability and behavior regulation difficulty due to increased frustration and rigidity. {{CHILD_NAME}} likely expends a high level of emotional energy to regulate his/herself at school and becomes more dysregulated in the home environment. Often treatment of OCD and anxiety is sufficient to substantially decrease oppositional behavior. Several treatment options are recommended below to improve {{CHILD_NAME}}'s coping skills and tolerance for frustration.
## Pica
### Subthreshold Pica
{{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed frequent/occasional'ingesting of nonnutritive and nonfood substances (i.e., specific behavior) for {{CHILD_NAME}}, which is developmentally inappropriate and not culturally supported. Considering limitations of the current evaluation, as well as lack of information whether {{CHILD_NAME}} is ingesting (insert specific behavior), it is recommended {{CHILD_NAME}}'s parents continue to monitor the symptoms and consult with {{CHILD_NAME}}'s pediatrician for further evaluation.
## Psychosis/Perceptual Disturbance
### Other specified psychotic disorder (attenuated psychosis syndrome)
{{PARENT_NAME}} revealed a history of auditory hallucinations (e.g., ______) and persecutory delusions (e.g., ________) since age XX for {{CHILD_NAME}}. No symptoms such as signs of disorganized behavior or negative symptoms were reported. However, his/her persistent auditory hallucinations and delusions are concerning and negatively impact his/her family functioning, thus warranting a diagnosis of Other Psychotic Disorder (attenuated psychosis syndrome). An Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome, if present, may account for difficulties with attention as well as some disruptive behaviors currently captured by the ADHD. [CS26]{{PARENT_NAME}} reported a significant decrease in {{CHILD_NAME}}'s auditory hallucinations since starting a trial of XXX (XX mg); however, these symptoms should continue to be closely monitored. Cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis is also recommended to help {{CHILD_NAME}} change the way he/she thinks about and responds to these symptoms.[CS27]
### Subthreshold Perceptual Disturbance w/ imaginary sibling
{{PARENT_NAME}} additionally reported concerns regarding {{CHILD_NAME}} seemingly living in a 'fantasy world' and engaging in play with an imaginary sibling. Often children engage in imaginary play as a coping mechanism for anxiety and dealing with environmental stressors. Considering that imaginary play is still developmentally appropriate at {{CHILD_NAME}}'s age and that there is no associated distress or impairment, these behaviors are not clinically concerning at this time. Instead, therapeutic interventions targeting {{CHILD_NAME}}'s aforementioned anxiety will likely decrease his/her need for creating a fantasy world. Additionally, involvement in extracurricular and social activities will help {{CHILD_NAME}} create real relationships and better engage in reality.
## Sensory Difficulties
### Sensory Vulnerabilities w/o ASD (Misophonia)
Lastly, subthreshold symptoms related to sensory vulnerabilities were endorsed by {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent during the clinical interview. Specifically, {{PARENT_NAME}} expressed concerns regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s sensory sensitivities to auditory input (e.g., intolerance to hearing people chewing and eating) and related distress (e.g., unable to eat in school cafeteria, requires use of headphones during meals, reluctance to eat in public places). Although this is not captured by the current diagnoses outlined below, these behaviors should continue to be closely monitored and could be addressed within the context of exposure response prevention (ERP) and/or a sensory evaluation through occupational therapy.
### Sensory/Motor Difficulties w/o ASD
{{PARENT_NAME}} expressed some concern regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s sensory sensitivities (e.g., ____) and underdeveloped motor skills (e.g., ____). Although these behaviors are not captured by the current diagnoses outlined below, these behaviors should continue to be closely monitored and could be addressed within the context of psychotherapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and/or social skills groups.
## Sleep Problems
### Falling asleep in class and during eval
Per observation, {{CHILD_NAME}} appeared tired during participation in the study and fell asleep on several occasions, both on remote appointments and during in-person testing. Considering his/her history of sleep apnea and his/her recent weight gain, it is strongly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} participate in a sleep medicine consultation to determine if he/she should have an updated sleep study or other evaluations in ruling out a sleep disorder.
### Sleep Terrors
Lastly, {{PARENT_NAME}} reports that {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences night terrors (approximately X per month). Aside from these incidents, there were no concerns regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s sleep.
{{PARENT_NAME}} can consult with {{CHILD_NAME}}'s pediatrician in order to rule out sleep apnea. Oftentimes night terrors can improve without intervention. Sleep hygiene (see below) and managing stress and anxiety can also be helpful.
### Insomnia
#### rule out
In addition, {{PARENT_NAME}} reported that {{CHILD_NAME}} frequently (i.e., X times per week) has difficulty falling asleep and requires assistance from his/her parents to fall asleep. Given the level of distress {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences related to his/her trouble falling asleep, a diagnosis of insomnia disorder was considered for him/her. However, it was unclear from {{PARENT_NAME}}'s reports whether {{CHILD_NAME}} meets the frequency criteria for insomnia disorder. Furthermore, it is possible that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms may be better accounted for by his/her high levels of anxiety. Therefore, insomnia disorder is being listed as a rule-out below. {{CHILD_NAME}} may benefit from sleep hygiene techniques and therapy to reduce his/her overall level of stress.
### Poor sleep hygiene
#### w/ difficulty falling asleep
Regarding sleep, {{PARENT_NAME}} reported that, {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences difficulty falling  asleep and engages in habits which are not conducive to good sleep (e.g., playing video games late into the night, varying his/her sleep/wake schedule).

#### w/o difficulty falling asleep
Lastly, regarding sleep, {{PARENT_NAME}} reported that, although {{CHILD_NAME}} does not experience difficulty falling or staying asleep when he/she wants to sleep, he/she frequently engages in habits which are not conducive to good sleep (e.g., playing video games late into the night, varying his/her sleep/wake schedule). Given the important role that sleep has in maintaining mental health, and especially the detrimental impact that lack of sleep can have on ADHD, mood, and anxiety, recommendations for improving sleep hygiene are offered below.
### Sleepwalking- Subthreshold
{{PARENT_NAME}} reports {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences sleepwalking episodes (approximately __ time(s) per night/week/month).  Aside from these incidents, there were no concerns regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s sleep.  Given the severity and denied impairment, {{CHILD_NAME}} does not meet criteria for a Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorder.  {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms should be monitored and a reevaluation to rule out a sleep disorder may be warranted if the symptoms increase in severity and impairment.  {{PARENT_NAME}} can consult with {{CHILD_NAME}}'s pediatrician to determine if there is a medical etiology for the sleep disturbance.  Sleep hygiene and managing stress (see below) can also be beneficial.
## Substance-Induced Depressive Disorder
{{CHILD_NAME}} reports experiencing single/recurrent episode(s) of X/9 frequent symptoms of depression, including depressed mood and loss of interest around the same time he started smoking marijuana heavily. Considering the level of distress and impairment these symptoms cause {{CHILD_NAME}}, as well as the onset of his substance use, {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for Substance-Induced Depressive Disorder.  {{CHILD_NAME}} 's depressive symptoms should be monitored.  A re-evaluation to rule out a major depressive disorder, single/recurrent episode would be warranted if {{CHILD_NAME}}'s depressive symptoms persist or the severity of symptoms increase after effective treatment for his/her cannabis use disorder.
## Substance Use Disorders
### Cannabis Use
#### Mild
##### standard
{{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent reported consistent marijuana use for {{CHILD_NAME}} beginning in approximately X grade. {{CHILD_NAME}} endorsed using almost every day, spending a significant amount of time and effort to obtain and use cannabis and a failure to fulfill his/her school responsibilities associated with smoking. As such, {{CHILD_NAME}} warrants a diagnosis of Cannabis Use Disorder, Mild. In consideration of his/her other symptomology, past and current life-stressors, and school underachievement, we are concerned that without appropriate treatment, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s substance use will increase and cause substantial impairment in his/her functioning. Furthermore, one of the risks of cannabis use is that it further confounds psychiatric symptoms (i.e. ____), making them less responsive to treatment. Thus, it is strongly recommended that he/she be engaged in effective interventions (as described below) that focus on building up his/her coping skills, as well as helping him/her abstain from substance use.
##### w/ previous reduction in use at camp
{{CHILD_NAME}} also reported ongoing marijuana use, which his/her parent later indicated has decreased since {{CHILD_NAME}} started school again in MONTH YEAR. However, {{CHILD_NAME}} prior reported difficulty controlling his/her use, strong desire to use and persistent desire to reduce marijuana use. {{CHILD_NAME}} noted he/she was able to reduce use for one month in the summer when he/she was in camp. Considering his/her use has interfered with his/her school responsibilities and frequently leads to arguments in the home, a diagnosis of a mild Cannabis Use Disorder is listed below. It is important to note that one of the risks of substance use is that it further confounds psychiatric symptoms (i.e. depressive and anxiety disorders), making them less responsive to treatment. Additionally, cannabis is known to interfere with executive functioning and attention, domains of particular vulnerability for {{CHILD_NAME}}. Thus, it is strongly recommended that he/she be engaged in effective interventions (as described below) that focus on building up his/her coping skills, as well as helping him/her abstain from substance use.
#### Subthreshold
Lastly, {{CHILD_NAME}} reported marijuana use on a consistent basis since starting college. Although he/she does not meet diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder, in consideration of his/her other symptomology, past life-stressors, and school underachievement, we are concerned that without appropriate treatment, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s substance use may increase and cause further impairment in his/her functioning. Furthermore, one of the risks of cannabis use is that it further confounds psychiatric symptoms (i.e. mood or anxiety disorder, inattention), making them less responsive to treatment. Thus, it is strongly recommended that he/she be engaged in effective interventions (as described below) that focus on building up his/her coping skills, as well as helping him/her abstain from substance use.
## Tic Disorders
### Other Specified Tics
{{PARENT_NAME}} reported the presence of simple motor and vocal tics, which have appeared for short intervals (1-2 weeks) and then disappear, since {{CHILD_NAME}} was X years old. Although the period between the onset of tics to present is longer than one year, he/she does not meet criteria for Tourette's disorder, based on his/her parents report that he/she displays mostly tic-free intervals with little persistence of the tics. As such, a diagnosis of Other Specified Tic Disorder is listed below to account for the presence of short duration vocal and motor tics. Tics wax and wane over time but, for some children, can recur particularly leading into puberty. It is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s tics be monitored and further evaluated by a pediatric psychiatrist if they worsen in the coming adolescent years. Psychotherapeutic intervention (such as Habit Reversal Training) can be considered if impairment is noted.
### Past Tic Disorder
A history of a motor tic lasting for one year was also reported; as such a past diagnosis of Persistent Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder, with motor tics only is also warranted.
### Persistent (Chronic) Motor or Vocal Tic
#### standard
{{PARENT_NAME}} has observed {{CHILD_NAME}} to experience at least one motor/vocal [CS31]tic (e.g., ______) over a duration of time lasting X. As such, {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for Persistent (Chronic) Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder. Several treatment options are available, which will be outlined below.
#### coughing w/ Anxiety
Lastly, {{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} reported the presence of a vocal tic (i.e. coughing) since the age of X years old. The tic reportedly waxes and wanes associated with stress. An additional diagnosis of Persistent Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder, With Vocal Tics Only is listed below. Tic Disorders commonly co-occur with anxiety. Tics wax and wane over time but, for some children, can recur particularly leading into puberty. It is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s tics be monitored and further evaluated by his/her psychiatrist if they worsen in coming adolescent years. Psychotherapeutic intervention (such as Habit Reversal Training) can be considered if impairment is noted.
#### Motor tics w ASD and ADHD
Lastly, {{PARENT_NAME}} reported the presence of motor tic-like behavior for the past 12-14 months. Although some of these orchestrated movement sequences can be consistent with sensory seeking or repetitive stereotyped behaviors associated with ASD, the seemingly involuntary and purposeful nature of the movements suggest that an additional diagnosis of Persistent Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder, With Motor Tics Only is warranted. Tic Disorders commonly co-occur with ADHD and ASD. Recommendations for psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological approaches are provided below.
#### Motor tics w ASD
Lastly, motor tic-like behavior was observed over the course of the current evaluation (i.e. touching his/her face, blinking, touching his/her arms, pushing himself up in his/her seat). Although some of these orchestrated movement sequences can be consistent with sensory seeking or repetitive stereotyped behaviors associated with ASD, the seemingly involuntary and purposeful nature of the movements suggest that an additional diagnosis of Persistent Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder, With Motor Tics Only is warranted. Tic Disorders commonly co-occur with ASD. Recommendations for psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological approaches are provided below.
### Provisional Tic Disorder
#### standard
{{PARENT_NAME}} has observed {{CHILD_NAME}} to experience multiple motor tics (e.g. _____) and/or multiple vocal tics (e.g., ______) over a duration of time lasting less than one year. As such, {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for Provisional Tic Disorder. Several treatment options are available, which will be outlined below.
#### requires confirmation from pediatrition
{{PARENT_NAME}} noted the presence of vocal and motor tics that started to occur within the past year. As these tics were reported to have been present for less than one year, a Provisional Tic Disorder diagnosis is warranted. An evaluation by a pediatric psychiatrist should be considered to confirm the diagnosis and determine treatment options.
#### touching nose and forehead
Lastly, complex motor tics (i.e. touching his/her nose then forehead) were reported for a span of 3 months when {{CHILD_NAME}} was X years old. Given that the duration was less than 12 months, a past diagnosis of a Provisional Tic Disorder is listed below. Tics wax and wane over time but, for some children, can recur particularly leading into puberty. Because of this, it is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her family monitor for any recurrence of tic symptoms.
### Subthreshold/ rule-out with ASD
#### vocal - loud noises and provocative words
Lastly, {{PARENT_NAME}} reported the presence of vocal tic-like behavior in the form of frequent loud noises and provocative words. It is unclear at present if the noises and words are out of {{CHILD_NAME}}'s control. {{CHILD_NAME}} appears to engage in these behaviors as a self-stimulatory behavior. It is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s tic-like behavior be monitored and further evaluated by a pediatric psychiatrist if they worsen in the coming adolescent years.
#### past vocal - humming
Lastly, {{PARENT_NAME}} reported the presence of vocal tic-like behavior in the form of humming, which lasted for a few months and then subsided. It is unclear at present if the noises were self-stimulatory, a tic or anxiety related. It is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s tic-like behavior be monitored and further evaluated by a pediatric psychiatrist if it resurfaces in coming years.
#### motor
Lastly, {{PARENT_NAME}} reported the presence of motor tic-like behavior for the past 12 months. This behavior was not observed during evaluation. Although orchestrated movement sequences can be consistent with repetitive stereotyped behaviors associated with ASD, the presence of these tics in the context of prior clear simple motor tics of the cheek suggest that an additional diagnosis of Persistent Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder, With Motor Tics Only should be ruled out in future treatment. Tic Disorders commonly co-occur with ASD. Consultation with {{CHILD_NAME}}'s treating psychiatrist regarding the tics is recommended.
### Tourette's Disorder
#### standard
In addition, a number of behavioral concerns were endorsed for {{CHILD_NAME}} during the clinical interview. {{PARENT_NAME}} has observed {{CHILD_NAME}} to experience multiple motor tics (e.g. _____) and at least one vocal tic (e.g., ______) over a duration of time lasting longer than one year. As such, {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for Tourette's Disorder. Several treatment options are available, which will be outlined below.
#### tics have remitted and reappeared
{{PARENT_NAME}} indicated the presence of simple motor tics and vocal tics starting when {{CHILD_NAME}} was X years old which have remitted and reappeared over the past X years. Given that the tics have been reported for a duration of time longer than one year, he/she meets criteria for a diagnosis of Tourette's Disorder. {{PARENT_NAME}} denied interference or impairment from tics, as they are unnoticeable to most people, including {{CHILD_NAME}}. It is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s tics be monitored and further evaluated by a pediatric psychiatrist if they worsen in the coming adolescent years.
#### w/ coughing, throat clearning, moving hair, blinking
{{PARENT_NAME}} indicated a history of vocal tics (i.e. coughing and throat clearing), and motor tics (i.e. clearing his/her hair from his/her face), which have come and gone since {{CHILD_NAME}} was in 4th grade. They also endorsed the current presence of repetitive facial movements (i.e. eye blinking), which have been present for approximately one year. Tic Disorders commonly co-occur with ADHD and anxiety disorders. Given that the tics have been reported for a duration of time longer than one year, he/she meets criteria for a diagnosis of Tourette's Disorder. It is recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s tics be monitored and further evaluated by a pediatric psychiatrist.
## Trauma (PTSD, Attachment)
### PTSD: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
#### standard
In addition, {{PARENT_NAME}} and {{CHILD_NAME}} indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} has been exposed to a traumatic event (e.g., ____). Following this exposure, {{CHILD_NAME}} began experiencing X/5 intrusion symptoms (e.g., _____), X/2 avoidance symptoms (e.g., _____), X/7 cognitive or emotional symptoms (e.g., _____), and X/6 arousal symptoms (e.g., _____). Given the level of distress and impairment {{CHILD_NAME}} experiences across settings as a result of these symptoms, a diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is warranted. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful in addressing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s trauma-related symptoms and in augmenting his/her repertoire of adaptive coping strategies that can be applied to additional psychosocial stressors.
#### w/ unstable living conditions, witness of domestic violence, parent's illness
These reports indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for a diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to several endorsed factors. First, {{CHILD_NAME}} has witnessed and experienced several traumatic events (e.g. unstable living conditions, witness of domestic violence and experience of his/her parent's near-death illness). Second, he/she has experienced intrusive symptoms associated with the traumatic event (e.g. previous frequent scary nightmares). Third, he/she reports he/she persistently avoids thoughts, feelings and memories related to the traumatic events. Fourth, he/she has experienced several negative alterations in cognitions and mood associated with the negative events (e.g. blaming his/herself for his/her parent's miscarriage, increased difficulty trusting others, increased irritability). In addition, {{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed that {{CHILD_NAME}} experienced heightened sad feelings following some of the above-mentioned experiences, although currently those feelings appeared to have remitted. Fifth, {{CHILD_NAME}} has experienced marked changes in arousal and reactivity associated with the traumatic events (e.g. hypervigilance, problems with concentration and sleep disturbances). The endorsed symptoms were reported to have lasted for a period of time longer than one month and have caused impairment in {{CHILD_NAME}}'s school, social and family functioning. Therapeutic interventions can assist {{CHILD_NAME}} in processing his/her traumatic experiences and thereby improve his/her overall wellbeing.
#### Past incorrect PTSD dx, w/ IED
With regard to {{CHILD_NAME}}'s history of trauma, he/she was previously diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) at age X, due to emotional and behavioral difficulties which began following {{CHILD_NAME}}'s stay in foster care, during which time, {{PARENT_NAME}} reports that {{CHILD_NAME}} was abused and neglected. The results of the current psychiatric interview did not find evidence sufficient to meet criteria for past or current diagnosis of PTSD. However, {{CHILD_NAME}} continues to present with emotional and behavioral difficulties consistent with emotional dysregulation in children with a history of neglect and abuse. Specifically, {{CHILD_NAME}} exhibits severe temper outbursts in school, in which he/she is aggressive towards adults and poses a safety risk to his/her peers. Due to the severity and frequency of {{CHILD_NAME}}'s outbursts at school, criteria are met for Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED). As such, in addition to the previously mentioned structured classroom setting and behavioral support at school, {{CHILD_NAME}} requires behaviorally-based psycho-therapeutic treatment to improve his/her tolerance for frustration and learn adaptive coping skills.
### Additional Dxes w/ PTSD (Complex Trauma)
{{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent also endorsed several emotional symptoms and behavioral concerns that extend beyond those captured by the PTSD diagnosis. It is not uncommon for children with complex trauma histories to meet criteria for diagnoses in addition to PTSD.
### DSED: Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder
In addition, a number of behavioral and emotional concerns were endorsed for {{CHILD_NAME}} during the clinical interview. {{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed that {{CHILD_NAME}} actively approaches unfamiliar adults and inappropriately interacts with them (e.g., _____). These symptoms began following a period of time in which {{CHILD_NAME}} received insufficient care (e.g., _____). As such, full criteria for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder are met. The relationship between {{CHILD_NAME}} and {{PARENT_NAME}} can be addressed within the context of family therapy as well as Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT).
### Exposure to Trauma/Stress - No Diagnosis
#### standard
Lastly, regarding his/her trauma history, {{PARENT_NAME}} reports {{CHILD_NAME}} was exposed to ____ at age X years. The present evaluation did not find sufficient evidence warranting a diagnosis of a stress or trauma related disorder. However, it is suggested that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms relating to trauma be continually monitored and assessed in therapy.
#### domestic violence
Regarding his/her trauma history, {{CHILD_NAME}} was exposed to domestic violence and several family stressors from the age of X to X years. {{PARENT_NAME}} reports that {{CHILD_NAME}} continues to experience distressing memories of these events, as well as hypervigilance. However, {{CHILD_NAME}} denied all intrusion symptoms associated with these events as well as avoidance of associated stimuli. The present evaluation did not find sufficient evidence warranting a diagnosis of a stress or trauma related disorder. It is crucial however that {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms relating to trauma be monitored and assessed in therapy. He/She will likely need more time to develop trust and rapport in a psychotherapeutic relationship. As he/she becomes more comfortable in a psychotherapy treatment, {{CHILD_NAME}} may reveal symptoms for which he/she was less comfortable expressing during this brief research assessment. Accordingly, diagnosis of a trauma and stress related disorder may need to be readdressed in this context.
#### neglect and sexual abuse
These results indicate that {{CHILD_NAME}} does not currently meet criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis. However, {{PARENT_NAME}} reported significant family stressors for {{CHILD_NAME}}, including multiple changes in living arrangements, experiencing prolonged neglect, and allegedly experiencing sexual abuse while in his/her biological parent's care. As several chronic stressors remain (e.g., parents' mental health diagnoses), {{CHILD_NAME}} may benefit from ongoing psychotherapy to address related feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. Of note, he/she will likely need more time to develop trust and rapport in a psychotherapeutic relationship. As he/she becomes more comfortable in a psychotherapy treatment, {{CHILD_NAME}} may reveal symptoms for which he/she was less comfortable expressing during this brief research assessment. Accordingly, diagnostic formulation may need to be readdressed in this context.
#### school and family stress
It is important to note that {{CHILD_NAME}} reported significant school and family stressors, including multiple changes in schools and verbal and physical aggression in the home. {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms related to these stressors did not meet criteria for a diagnosis of trauma related disorder. Nevertheless, as several chronic stressors remain, {{CHILD_NAME}} may benefit from psychotherapy to address related feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. Of note, he/she will likely need more time to develop trust and rapport in a psychotherapeutic relationship. As he/she becomes more comfortable in a psychotherapy treatment, {{CHILD_NAME}} may reveal symptoms for which she was less comfortable expressing during this brief research assessment. Accordingly, diagnostic formulation may need to be readdressed in this context.
### RAD: Reactive Attachment Disorder
#### standard
In addition, a number of behavioral and emotional concerns were endorsed for {{CHILD_NAME}} during the clinical interview. {{PARENT_NAME}} endorsed that {{CHILD_NAME}} rarely seeks or responds to comfort from adult caregivers and exhibits persistent social and emotional difficulties (e.g., _____). These symptoms began following a period of time in which {{CHILD_NAME}} received insufficient care (e.g., _____). As such, full criteria for Reactive Attachment Disorder are met. The relationship between {{CHILD_NAME}} and {{PARENT_NAME}} can be addressed within the context of family therapy as well as Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT).
#### subthreshold
{{PARENT_NAME}} reported previous concerns regarding {{CHILD_NAME}}'s ability to form appropriate attachments since he/she was adopted at _____months of age/age ____ and placed in multiple institutions/foster homes prior to the adoption.  {{PARENT_NAME}} denied {{CHILD_NAME}} experienced social neglect or limited opportunities to development an attachment to a caregiver.  He/She displays appropriate positive affect, as well as appropriate social and emotional responsiveness to others.  Furthermore, he/she seeks and responds to comfort when distressed[MA33].  As such, symptoms are not sufficient for a diagnosis of Reactive Attachment Disorder.
### Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder
{{CHILD_NAME}} and {{PARENT_NAME}} completed the K-SADS semi-structured psychiatric interview for DSM-5 as well as several questionnaires related to emotional and behavioral function. These reports indicate that overall, {{CHILD_NAME}} is adjusting very well since his/her adoption. Specifically, he/she demonstrates remarkable resilience, healthy self-esteem and enjoys social relationships with his/her peers. {{PARENT_NAME}} did however indicate that prior to {{CHILD_NAME}}'s adoption, he/she exhibited emotional and behavioral difficulty in response to the abuse and neglect, which he/she experienced in Arizona. This included reported suicidal ideation, aggression and oppositional behavior. Considering more extensive details of {{CHILD_NAME}}'s functioning during this time are not available, a past diagnosis of Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor Related Disorder, is appropriate in characterizing {{CHILD_NAME}}'s past reported symptoms. The qualifier in partial remission is added to account for ongoing symptoms; Currently, {{CHILD_NAME}} and his/her parent both report mild ongoing symptoms associated with {{CHILD_NAME}}'s history of trauma and neglect, including difficulty expressing his/her emotions, subclinical separation anxiety, occasional dissociation and nightmares. {{CHILD_NAME}} also reported mild concerns with regards to social anxiety. Overall, however {{PARENT_NAME}} indicated that {{CHILD_NAME}} has made much progress with regards to these behaviors since the adoption and is responding well to his/her current psychotherapy using a Trauma-Focused CBT approach. {{CHILD_NAME}} does not meet criteria for any current psychiatric diagnoses, as the present symptoms were denied to cause impairment in functioning. It is strongly recommended that {{CHILD_NAME}} continue with his/her current psychotherapy in order to further strengthen his/her coping skills and address issues related to his/her trauma history.
### Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related D/O
#### w/ avoidance and negative alterations in cognitions and mood
In addition, historically and currently, following a traumatic event, {{CHILD_NAME}} exhibits symptoms related to avoidance of related stimuli and negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and these issues meet research-based DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for a diagnosis of Other Specified Trauma-and Stressor-Related Disorder. Of note, {{CHILD_NAME}}'s presentation does not meet diagnostic criteria for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or an Adjustment Disorder. Specifically, for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder diagnostic criteria to be met, in addition to the presence of avoidance symptoms and negative alterations in mood/ cognitions, intrusion symptoms and alterations in arousal/reactivity need to also be present/exhibited. Diagnostic criteria for an Adjustment Disorder includes that symptoms not be present for longer than six months in duration; {{CHILD_NAME}}'s symptoms have been present for approximately XX months/years.
#### intrusive thoughts and anger
Following a traumatic experience, _____, {{CHILD_NAME}} exhibits symptoms related to intrusive thoughts about the event, and some negative alterations in mood (e.g., anger) and some marked alterations in arousal (e.g., being on guard).  He/She denied any avoidance of related stimuli; thus, considering the distress and impairment related to the traumatic event, {{CHILD_NAME}} meets criteria for Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder.  {{CHILD_NAME}} would benefit from trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy to assist him/her in processing his/her traumatic experiences and thereby improving his/her overall wellbeing.
#### w/ intrusive memories, extreme anxiety, engaging in risky behaviors and avoidance of related stimuli following peer rejection
{{CHILD_NAME}} endorsed a past period of significant trauma and stress related symptoms, when he/she was X years old, in conjunction with being 'psychologically tormented,' by a peer group who rejected him/her.  Following this series of experiences, {{CHILD_NAME}} reports intrusive memories, extreme anxiety, engaging in risky behaviors and avoidance of related stimuli. {{CHILD_NAME}} denied current trauma related symptoms associated with these events. A past diagnosis of Other Specified Trauma and Stressor Related Disorder is appropriate in characterizing his/her symptoms during that time.
## Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling) Disorder
In addition, a number of behavioral concerns were endorsed for {{CHILD_NAME}} during the clinical interview. {{PARENT_NAME}} also endorsed symptoms of Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling) Disorder for {{CHILD_NAME}}. Specifically, he/she recurrently pulls out hair from his/her head/eyebrows/arms resulting in hair loss, particularly when he/she is anxious or stressed[CS34], across various settings (i.e., at home, in school). He/She will briefly stop when asked by others but will shortly re-engage in this behavior. {{CHILD_NAME}} will likely benefit from Habit Reversal Training (HRT), a behavioral therapy that helps reduce repetitive behaviors (i.e., hair pulling) by teaching children and their parents skills help notice the signs/urge that a repetitive behavior is starting and to prevent these behaviors.

2. Presumptive: Full criteria are likely met based on our evaluation and history of impairment, though HBN is unable to confirm the diagnosis due to a limitation in our evaluation protocol.  The disorder would be able to be confirmed following intervention without the need for additional testing.
3. Requires Confirmation: Full criteria are likely met based on our evaluation and history of impairment, though HBN is unable to confirm the diagnosis due to a limitation in our evaluation protocol.  Additionally, there is less evidence from our evaluation AND historic impairment and so less certainty than Presumptive.  The disorder would require further testing in order to confirm the diagnosis. ?
4. Rule-out: Symptoms of a disorder are not clearly defined within one diagnostic criteria and/or are similar or overlap with other presenting disorders. e.g., inattention in the context of an untreated learning disorder/ anxiety disorder. Recommendation would be to treat anxiety/add learning support , then further evaluate for ADHD
OR
Insufficient information in the HBN evaluation to make a diagnosis (or to say that the child definitively does not have a diagnosis), but concerns or vulnerabilities were evident that should be further evaluated /monitored e.g., concerns from parent about writing in educational history and behavior obs that child struggles with all writing tasks; rule-out SLD, with impairment in written expression?
5. Past: Full criteria for a disorder were reported during Mental Health Interview, though symptoms are reported to be no longer present for the past 2 months.
6. In Partial remission: Full criteria for a Major Depressive Disorder was reported during Mental Health Interview in the past. Currently there are still some symptoms of depression, but not enough to meet criteria for MDD. Can only be used as specified in the DSM
7. By History: A diagnosis of a disorder was reported during the HBN evaluation, though HBN is unable to confirm this diagnosis, either because the diagnosis is not fully assessed by HBN OR there was insufficient evidence on the HBN evaluation to confirm the previous diagnosis ? e.g., SLD, with impairment in written expression- not assessed?, Autism- not enough symptoms reported by parent and behavioral observations were inconsistent with autism.
8. Single Episode vs. Recurrent episodes of a Major Depressive episode
a. Count as recurrent episodes if there is a 2 month period with full remission of symptoms
b. If there is only partial remission of symptoms for any period within the course of the depression, count as part of one episode
c. If full remission of symptoms was less than 2 months, count as one episode
d. Anchor symptom count when depression is most severe
