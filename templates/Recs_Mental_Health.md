## Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

### General

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** is an evidence-based treatment that is based on the idea that an individual’s ways of thinking, behaving, and experiencing emotions are all related.  Children with anxiety often benefit from participating in a cognitive behavioral treatment that focuses on increasing their repertoire of cognitive coping for frustration, sad mood, and high-pressure situations.  First, they learn to monitor what kinds of thoughts they have in particular situations.  Next, they learn to practice positive self-talk when they begin to engage in catastrophic worrying.  As children learn to monitor their cognitions and engage in self-talk, they also learn to critically examine and modify underlying assumptions and distorted beliefs that lead to emotional difficulties. The dysfunctional thought patterns are replaced with a more realistic and adaptive belief system, and they learn to better cope with stressors and negative emotions. In addition, children should practice learning self-soothing and relaxation techniques including deep diaphragmatic breathing, mindfulness exercises, visualization strategies, and progressive muscle relaxation.  When treatment is successful, an individual experiences a stronger sense of self-efficacy.  These strategies are taught to both the child engaged in the intervention, as well as his/her parents, who are then better able to help and support their child practice the learned techniques.  

### Pediatric 

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Pediatric anxiety is typically treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a highly effective short-term psychotherapeutic intervention which is based on the idea that there is a relationship between how individuals think, behave, and experience emotions. When engaged in CBT, through various techniques, children learn how to better identify and regulate their emotions. In addition, to improve overall functioning, children are encouraged to develop coping strategies for life stressors. These strategies are taught to both the child engaged in the intervention, as well as his/her parents, who are then better able to help and support their child practice the learned techniques.  
    - *Coping Cat* is one particular manual-based cognitive behavioral treatment that assists school-age children in (1) recognizing anxious feelings and physical reactions to anxiety; (2) clarifying cognition in anxiety-provoking situations (i.e., unrealistic expectations); (3) developing a plan to help cope with the situation (i.e., determining what coping actions might be effective); and (4) evaluating performance and administering self-reinforcement as appropriate. The intervention uses behavioral training strategies with demonstrated efficacy, such as modeling real-life situations, role-playing, relaxation training, and contingent reinforcement. Throughout the sessions, therapists use social reinforcement to encourage and reward the children, and the children are encouraged to verbally reinforce their own successful coping. Coping Cat consists of 16 sessions. The first eight sessions are training sessions in which each of the basic concepts are introduced individually and then practiced and reinforced. In the second set of eight sessions, the child practices the new skills in both imaginary and real-life situations varying from low stress/low anxiety to high stress/high anxiety, depending on what is appropriate for each child.

### Adolescents 

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** is an evidence-based treatment that is based on the idea that an individual’s ways of thinking, behaving, and experiencing emotions are all related.  Adolescents with anxiety often benefit from participating in a cognitive behavioral treatment that focuses on increasing their repertoire of cognitive coping for frustration, sad mood, and high-pressure situations.  First, they learn to monitor what kinds of thoughts they have in particular situations.  Next, they learn to practice positive self-talk when they begin to engage in catastrophic worrying.  As adolescents learn to monitor their cognitions and engage in self-talk, they also learn to critically examine and modify underlying assumptions and distorted beliefs that lead to emotional difficulties. The dysfunctional thought patterns are replaced with a more realistic and adaptive belief system, and they learn to better cope with stressors and negative emotions. In addition, adolescents should practice learning self-soothing and relaxation techniques including deep diaphragmatic breathing, mindfulness exercises, visualization strategies, and progressive muscle relaxation.  When treatment is successful, an individual experiences a stronger sense of self-efficacy.
    - *The C.A.T. Project* is the adolescent version of *Coping Cat*. *The C.A.T. Project* is one particular manual-based cognitive behavioral treatment that assists adolescents in (1) recognizing anxious feelings and physical reactions to anxiety; (2) clarifying cognition in anxiety-provoking situations (i.e., unrealistic expectations); (3) developing a plan to help cope with the situation (i.e., determining what coping actions might be effective); and (4) evaluating performance and administering self-reinforcement as appropriate. The intervention uses behavioral training strategies with demonstrated efficacy, such as modeling real-life situations, role-playing, relaxation training, and contingent reinforcement. Throughout the sessions, therapists use social reinforcement to encourage and reward the children, and the children are encouraged to verbally reinforce their own successful coping. Coping Cat consists of 16 sessions. The first eight sessions are training sessions in which each of the basic concepts are introduced individually and then practiced and reinforced. In the second set of eight sessions, the individual practices the new skills in both imaginary and real-life situations varying from low stress/low anxiety to high stress/high anxiety, depending on what is appropriate for each individual.

## Parental Involvement - Anxiety

- **Parental Involvement:** Anxiety is often inadvertently reinforced and maintained over time by allowing a child to avoid certain situations, thus reinforcing the child’s avoidance rather than helping the child build and maintain skills. As such, it is helpful for parents to work with the therapist (or related professionals) to tailor their parenting techniques to be more effective in encouraging engagement in activities that the child finds difficult (e.g., sleeping in his/her own bed). The process is one of education for the parents, as they learn how to look for signs of growing anxiety and to help their child control it. 
    - *Child Anxiety Tales* is a 10-module evidence-based online parent-training program that empowers parents with tools and strategies to use to help their child manage anxiety and stress.  Child Anxiety Tales can be found online at https://www.CopingCatParents.com which has information, books, and referral network to help if parents are looking for providers or resources to help support their child.

## Organizational Skills Training

- **Organizational Skills Training**: (OST; Gallagher, Abikoff, & Spira, 2014) is an evidence-based program designed to improve organization, time management, planning skills, academic performance, and reduce family conflict over school, homework, and organization. It involves 20 sessions involving students, parents, and teachers.

## Parent Management Training 

- **Parent Management Training**: Parent Management Training (PMT) is an evidence-based treatment for children ages 3-13 in which parents are usually seen without the child present, although children may be asked to participate in some sessions. Skills to deal more effectively with challenging behaviors are taught and modeled by the therapist and then role-played with parents. After each session, parents practice the skills at home. Over the course of treatment, research shows that PMT interventions result in improved child compliance, decreased arguing and tantrums, improved parent-child interactions, and reduced parental stress. During parent training, parents learn skills on how to manage their children's behavior, including:
    1.	Having special time with your child
    2.	Increasing parental attention to positive behavior
    3.	Using effective commands to increase compliance
    4.	Using positive reinforcements (privileges, point charts) to increase compliance
    5.	Using consistent consequences for inappropriate behavior
    6.	Learning how to ignore misbehavior and attend to appropriate behavior
    7.	Learning how to handle more severe, infrequent behaviors	

## Social Skills 

- **Social Skills:** Social skills allow children to develop and maintain positive social relationships with peers, teachers, family, and community members. When children struggle with communication, problem-solving, self-management, and perspective-taking, it can interfere with social and academic development and functioning. Weaknesses in social skills can be understood as a skill or performance deficit, often improved by coaching and opportunities to practice skills. Behavioral skills training can address general social skills topics, such as verbal and non-verbal communication, making and maintaining friendships, problem-solving, perspective-taking, cooperative work/play, assertiveness, and effective responses to peer pressure and bullying. Groups often address the skill content as well as barriers that interfere with implementation. Children are given individualized goals for which they receive ongoing skills coaching and feedback and “take home” assignments intended to help them generalize lessons in various social situations.  

## Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA)

- **Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) Programming:** ABA is an intensive, structured teaching program in which skills are broken down and rehearsed in their simplest elements. His/her ABA programming may contain highly structured teaching for initial skill acquisition, which may involve strategies such as discrete trial teaching, behavioral shaping, chaining, differential reinforcement, and environmental modification. As his/her skills progress, the teaching should take place in naturalistic settings with a substantial degree of incidental teaching while Childname completes his/her daily activities to facilitate the generalization of skills and naturalistic learning. There should be a systematic and data-driven approach to fade the prompts and generalize the skills that Childname has acquired to more naturalistic settings. Childname’s ABA treatment should be implemented by a qualified behavioral specialist, such as a Board-Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) or professional with extensive training in ABA. Within this ABA programming, he/she should have clear and concrete goals for improving communication and social interaction, academic skills, daily adaptive skills, and decreasing challenging behaviors. Specific recommendations in these areas can be found below.
    1.	*Communication and Social:* Childname should focus on directing his/her speech to others, using phrase speech paired with appropriate nonverbal behaviors (e.g., eye contact and/or pointing) when requesting, engaging in social games, returning greetings and social bids by others, and initiating play or interactions with same-aged peers as well as establishing functional communication
    2.	*Play:* Childname should focus on functional and imaginary play with others, engaging in play with the same items or toys in a variety of ways, using many types of play sets both independently and with another peer, engaging in turn-taking games with peers and social partners, taking turns picking games, and following the lead of others in social play.
    3.	*Learning to Learn skills:* To facilitate Childname learning in an academic setting, his/her treatment should include goals for developing “learning to learn” skills, such as staying in the seat, attending to the material, and following individual and group instructions.
    4.	*Self-help Skills/Activities of Daily Living:* Childname is showing significant delays in activities of daily living and self-help skills. Childname will need programs to target the development of self-care, safety awareness, and community skills within his/her ABA programming. Examples of skills that should be included in his/her program are toileting, and understanding and following the safety rules at home and in the community. These skills can be broken down into small steps and taught in systematic ways to build up to more complex skills (e.g., behavioral chaining)
    5.	*Parent Training:* Childname’s ABA providers should also work intensively with his/her parents to help them learn and implement ABA-based strategies in their interactions with Childname in his/her natural environments, using a collaborative parent coaching approach. The involvement of Childname’s parents in his/her ABA treatment will be critical to ensure the generalization of his/her skills. The Rubi Autism Network Parent Training for Disruptive Behavior is recommended to be incorporated into Childname's home program. More on the Rubi protocol can be found online at https://www.rubinetwork.org/.

## Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)

### Social Anxiety and Phobias

- **Exposure and Response Prevention:** In this technique, individuals are exposed to the stimuli triggering their anxiety in structured, incremental steps, and in a safe setting. As they become accustomed to each of the triggers in turn, the anxiety fades, and they are ready to take on increasingly powerful ones. He/she will gradually develop a sense of confidence as skills are mastered. 

### OCD

- **Exposure and Response Prevention:** ERP is a specific type of cognitive behavioral therapy used to treat Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. The “exposure” part of this treatment involves direct or imagined controlled exposure to objects or situations that trigger obsessions that arouse anxiety. Over time, exposure to obsessional cues leads to less and less anxiety. Eventually, exposure to the obsessional cue arouses little anxiety at all. This process of getting "used to" obsessional cues is called “habituation.” The “response” in “response prevention” refers to the ritual behaviors that people with OCD engage in to reduce anxiety. In ERP treatment, patients learn to resist the compulsion to perform rituals and are eventually able to stop engaging in these behaviors.

## Behavioral Activation

- **Behavioral Activation:** A common strategy for individuals with depressive and withdrawal symptoms is behavioral activation, in which the therapist collaboratively works with the client on participating in daily activities that have a positive impact on their overall functioning. In addition, negative and distorted cognitions, and their impacts on the client’s thoughts and feelings, are also addressed in sessions.

## Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)

- **Dialectical Behavior Therapy:** DBT is a compassionate and evidence-based model that has proven to be effective for adolescents with labile mood and suicidality. DBT skills training group is focused on teaching behavioral skills and enhancing clients' capacity to tolerate distress. The group is run like a class where the group leader teaches the skills and assigns homework for clients to practice using the skills in their everyday lives. Groups meet on a weekly basis for approximately 2.5 hours and it takes 24 weeks to get through the full skills curriculum, which is often repeated to create a 1-year program. Briefer schedules that teach only a subset of the skills have also been developed for particular populations and settings. DBT individual therapy is focused on enhancing client motivation and helping clients to apply the skills to specific challenges and events in their lives. In the standard DBT model, individual therapy takes place once a week for as long as the client is in therapy and runs concurrently with skills groups. In the DBT model for adolescents, active parent participation in the treatment process is often requested. If these services cannot be pursued in the community, it is recommended that an individual provider implement these techniques during treatment.

## Multisystemic Therapy (MST) 

- **Multisystemic Therapy (MST)** is an intensive family- and community-based treatment program that focuses on addressing all environmental systems that impact young adults involved in the legal system/with significant conduct issues, including their homes and families, schools and teachers, neighborhoods and friends. MST recognizes that each system plays a critical role in a youth's world and each system requires attention when effective change is needed to improve the quality of life for youth and their families. The MST-SA program is for families with children (ages 11 to 17) with serious behavioral problems and/or substance abuse. MST-SA is a kind of therapy that helps prevent a youth’s behavior from getting to the point at which he/she needs to be removed from the home. Research shows that youth who repeatedly break the law and/or abuse drugs have trouble with school performance and relations with family, peers, and their community. MST-SA works with family members and others in the child’s life, like school teachers, guidance counselors, and coaches. The goal is to help parents address the needs of the youth more effectively. In order to receive these services, the family must agree to preventive services, which is funded through ACS. These services are provided in the home.

## Eating Disorder Therapies 

### Psychotherapy for Anorexia

- **Psychotherapy for Anorexia:** The most successful psychotherapeutic treatments for children and adolescents with anorexia involve the whole family. This consists of family therapy and psychoeducation that helps parents and siblings support the child with anorexia in returning to healthy eating patterns. The first goal is to help your child attain a healthy weight, and a child with anorexia should be immediately hospitalized if he or she is in medical danger. 

### Psychotherapy for Bulimia

- **Psychotherapy for Bulimia:** Bulimia is first treated through behavioral management. Psychotherapists address the purging behavior and focus on ensuring that the child is healthy. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also used to help the child or adolescent alter his or her body image and eating habits. Individuals are taught how their thoughts lead to negative emotions and unhealthy eating habits. Interpersonal psychotherapy, which focuses on one’s relationships with others and how this may result in negative emotions, is often incorporated into the treatment.  

### CBT for Bulimia Nervosa 

- ****CBT for Bulimia Nervosa:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for bulimia nervosa focuses on breaking the binge-purge cycle in bulimia by helping individuals establish a consistent pattern of eating, reducing concern about weight, challenging inaccurate beliefs about dieting, and identifying triggers for binge-purge episodes. Treatment can be delivered individually, in a group, or via self-help workbook (see resources below).

### Eating Disorder Treatment

- **Eating Disorder Treatment:** The most successful psychotherapeutic treatments for children and adolescents with eating disordered behavior involve the whole family. This consists of family therapy and psychoeducation that helps parents and siblings support the child with returning to healthy eating patterns. Therapy must address the purging behavior and focus on ensuring that the child is healthy. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also used to help the child or adolescent alter his or her body image and eating habits. Individuals are taught how their thoughts lead to negative emotions and unhealthy eating habits. Interpersonal psychotherapy, which focuses on one’s relationships with others and how this may result in negative emotions, is often incorporated into the treatment.  

## Elimination Disorder Treatments 

### Encopresis

- **Treatment for Encopresis**: Treatment for encopresis will typically involve cleaning out the colon and rectum, using stool-softening agents and beginning to build the habit of having frequent, healthy bowel movements. The initial cleaning of the colon and rectum is done using enemas, laxatives or both. During the next phase, a doctor will most likely continue to prescribe a daily dose of stool softeners or laxatives, to keep the child’s stool soft while his/her bowel returns from “stretched” to normal size. The third part of treatment focuses on learning, or re-learning, healthy bowel movement habits. Doctors recommend that a child being treated for encopresis be required to sit on the toilet for 10-15 minutes per day at a regularly scheduled time, usually following a meal, and attempt to have a bowel movement. Doctors may also recommend dietary changes such as increased fiber and the reduction of constipation-causing foods. Over time, with the proper guidance, children can redevelop a positive association with regular, healthy bowel movements. If a child has experienced feelings of shame, guilt or depression as a result of having encopresis, a knowledgeable psychotherapist can help him/her both understand those feelings and develop techniques for having regular healthy bowel movements. Please see https://childmind.org/guide/guide-to-encopresis/ for additional information.

### Enuresis

- **Treatment for Enuresis:** Although many approaches to treating enuresis have included behavioral modification, by far the most effective have been "conditioning" alarm units. The alarm unit is designed to awaken the child when he/she begins to wet. The small units are self-contained and the child wears it on the shoulder or the wrist. The unit is activated by a small electrode sewn or attached directly onto the child's underclothing. The principle of conditioning therapy is that repetitively arousing the child at the time of the wetting episode can ultimately condition the child to recognize that urination is about to happen, and teach the child to inhibit the voiding reflex. Therefore, it is essential during the first few weeks for the parents to wake the child completely when the alarm goes off. In addition, the following strategies may be helpful:
    1.	Increase fluid intake earlier in the day and reduce it later in the day. If school allows, give your child a water bottle and encourage him/her to drink steadily all day to avoid excessive thirst in the afternoon.
    2.	Schedule bathroom breaks every two to three hours throughout the day and right before bedtime.
    3.	Check whether your child is having regular bowel movements. Constipation can contribute to bedwetting.
    4.	Consider waking your child once during the night to urinate.
    5.	Do not punish accidents, but encourage your child to assist with cleaning up after an accident (e.g., changing bedsheets and clothes).
    6.	Reward success (e.g., provide praise or a special treat after attaining dryness goals).
    7.	Note: There is no known medication that cures enuresis — medications can only treat symptoms. When the drug is stopped, the enuresis will usually return unless the child has naturally outgrown it. Two commonly used medications are Tofranil (imipramine) and DDAVP (desmopressin acetate).

## Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)

****Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)** is an evidence-based treatment for children and adolescents impacted by trauma and their parents or caregivers. The goal of TF-CBT is to help address the biopsychosocial needs of children with problems related to traumatic life experiences, and their parents or primary caregivers. TF-CBT combines trauma-sensitive interventions with cognitive behavioral therapy. Children and parents are provided knowledge and skills related to processing the trauma; managing distressing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; and enhancing safety, parenting skills, and family communication. 

## Substance Abuse

### Substance Abuse Therapy/Rehabilitation

- **Substance Abuse Therapy/Rehabilitation**: Given Childname's history of substance abuse, it is strongly recommended that he/she undergo intensive outpatient substance abuse treatment (see list of referrals/providers).

### Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Relapse Prevention Training (RPT) - Cannabis

- **Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Relapse Prevention Training (RPT)**: MI and RPT are two effective therapeutic interventions to help cease Childname’s substance use, specifically with cannabis. Specifically, MI is a client-centered approach used to aid in enhancing an individual’s intrinsic motivation to initiate behavioral change by exploring and resolving possible ambivalence. RPT consists of a variety of interventions to teach individuals who are trying to maintain behavioral changes by learning how to anticipate and cope with the problem of relapse.

## Family Therapy

- **Family Therapy:** Family therapy is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on understanding and treating problems and difficult situations by working with the entire family unit, as opposed to individuals. Family therapy supports family members improve communication and resolve conflict. During sessions, family members are given the opportunity to express and explore difficult thoughts and emotions, appreciate each other’s needs, build upon members’ strengths, and make productive changes in the relationships between and among members. Family therapy is often short-term and time-limited intervention.


## Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT)

- **Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT)**: CBIT is a highly structured therapy that typically takes place in a therapist’s office on a weekly basis. The standard treatment is 8 sessions over 10 weeks but can be longer or shorter depending on the needs of the patient and his/her family. The first step in CBIT is to teach the patient to become more aware of his/her tics and the urge to tic. Next, the patient is taught to perform a specific behavior that makes the tic more difficult to do, as soon as the tic or urge appears. This “competing response” helps to reduce, and in some cases, even eliminate the tic. For example, a youngster with a frequent throat clearing tic would be taught to engage in slow rhythmic breathing whenever he/she felt the urge to clear his/her throat. A competing response chosen for a head-shaking tic might be gently tensing the head or neck muscles. Consistent and repeated practice of a carefully chosen competing response done at the appropriate time is necessary for the treatment to be effective. The final step of CBIT, the functional intervention (FI), is based on the fact that certain situations or reactions to tics can make them worse than they might otherwise be. The goal of FI is to identify these situations and have the patient and family attempt to change them so the tics aren’t made worse unnecessarily. For example, someone whose tics get worse when doing homework or before a presentation at work would be taught to manage their stress before and during these situations. 

## Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for Chronic Pain

- **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Chronic Pain:** Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a short-term, evidence-based treatment which focuses on helping clients bring attention to the present moment and live their lives in line with their goals and values, while learning not to attempt to control or avoid negative internal experiences (e.g., pain). Through ACT, clients learn how attempts to control or avoid chronic pain can paradoxically lead to increased distress and pain-related symptoms, and they are encouraged to explore behaviors that they can pursue to improve overall quality of life and daily functioning.

## Dialectical Behavioral Therapy for Children (DBT-C) and Mood Masters

- **Dialectical Behavioral Therapy for Children (DBT-C) and Mood Masters:** DBT-C and Mood Masters teach emotional regulation, mindfulness, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness skills, which are combined with parent management training, which teaches parents the skills to help their kids rein in their disruptive behavior. DBT-C and Mood Masters teach DBT skills to parents as well as kids, so they can help their children practice using them — and use the skills themselves. More information can be found on our website at: https://childmind.org/center/dialectical-behavior-therapy-children-preadolescents/
    1.	**DBT-C**: DBT-C is an empirically supported adaptation of DBT for children and preadolescents ages 7 to 12 years old. It is a comprehensive DBT program that has been modified to fit the needs of children in this age range. DBT-C begins with an extensive parent-training component, followed by weekly or twice-weekly family therapy sessions with a focus on building, practicing and reinforcing new coping skills to achieve emotional and behavioral regulation. Families receive individualized attention as they work together to improve upon and practice their skills together with the support of an experienced clinician.
    2.	**Mood Masters**: The Mood Masters program is a comprehensive DBT intervention for children and pre-adolescents who are 8 to 13 years old, as well as their parents. Mood Masters includes all components of adherent DBT in a format that has been modified to fit the needs of this age group. Mood Masters families receive specialized teaching and support from our clinical team to manage big behaviors and big emotions at home, at school, and in the community.

## Dialectical Behavioral Therapy-Prolonged Exposure (DBT-PE)

- **Dialectical Behavioral Therapy-Prolonged Exposure (DBT-PE):** DBT-PE is recommended when there is a presence of PTSD symptoms and chronic suicidal behaviors. DBT-PE is an empirically supported therapeutic treatment for adolescents and adults with PTSD who require stabilization prior to engaging in trauma-focused PTSD treatment.  Specifically, the first step aims at reducing suicidal behavior(s).  Avoidance is a major factor maintaining PTSD symptoms and prevents recovery.  As such, the DBT-PE protocol aims to help clients stop avoidance and instead confront trauma-related thoughts and situations so the trauma can be effectively processed.  DBT-PE uses two types of exposure: imaginal exposure and processing, and in vivo exposure.  The treatment is delivered in 3 stages.  Stage 1 begins with a focus of stabilization by increasing behavioral skills in the areas of emotion regulation, distress tolerance, mindfulness, and interpersonal effectiveness.  Stage 2 focuses on directly focusing on treating the PTSD.  Stage 3 focuses on improving relationships and increasing productive activities.

## Family Systems Therapy

- **Family Systems Therapy:** Childname and his/her parents would benefit from family therapy to improve interpersonal dynamics that may be contributing to his/her symptoms. It is recommended that his/her parents participate in weekly or bi-weekly sessions to learn methods to communicate in an effective and supportive way with Childname.

## Habit Reversal Training

### Tics and Excoriation

**Habit Reversal Training (HRT):** Childname may benefit from HRT, a form of behavioral therapy, which has been shown to help reduce tics and skin- picking. HRT teaches children and their parents skills to notice the signs that a tic is starting. Specifically, children and parents will learn to become more aware of the settings in which tics are most likely to occur, and replace tics with more adaptive behaviors (e.g., instead of doing an eye blink tic, gently close eyelids and hold them closed for several seconds). HRT also incorporates relaxation techniques to manage stress, which if not managed, may make tics worse.

### Excoriation and Hair Pulling

**Habit Reversal Training (HRT):** Habit reversal training is a subtype of cognitive behavior therapy specifically intended for repetitive behaviors, including excoriation and hair pulling.  First, the patient self-monitors the behavior. Next, the patient has to develop and practice an alternative behavior that replaces the problematic behavior.  This new behavior must be physically incompatible with the problematic behavior.  Lastly, it is important that family members become involved in the treatment process and provide support to the patient as they practice their skills.  

### Excoriation 

**Habit Reversal Training (HRT):** Childname may benefit from HRT, a form of behavioral therapy, which has been shown to help reduce skin-picking. HRT teaches children and their parents skills to notice the signs that a behavior is starting. Specifically, children and parents will learn to become more aware of the settings in which skin-picking is most likely to occur, and replace skin-picking with more adaptive behaviors. HRT also incorporates relaxation techniques to manage stress, which if not managed, may make skin-picking worse.

## CBT for Hoarding

**CBT for Hoarding:** Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) with a therapist who has experience treating anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorders is recommended. CBT helps children understand why they feel compelled to hoard and teaches them how to decide which possessions are worth keeping and which should be discarded. Therapy often involves work with parents to set up a behavioral plan, to first stop the child from acquiring new things and then use incentives to work on gradually getting rid of some of his/her hoarded objects.   Sometimes Hoarding Disorder can be associated with a broader diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  

## Panic Control Therapy (PCT)

- **Panic Control Therapy (PCT):** PCT is a brief treatment that incorporates psychoeducation, relaxation training , cognitive restructuring, and interoceptive exposure (exposure to the physical sensations associated with panic attacks).

## Parent Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT)

- **Parent Child Interaction Therapy:** Research shows that parent-training interventions are effective in treating outbursts that have not responded to other behavioral treatments. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is a highly effective, empirically supported behavioral treatment for both parents and children. It teaches parents specialized techniques for setting limits, reducing a child's disruptive behavior and strengthening the parent-child relationship. PCIT is effective for children between the ages of 2 and 7, and usually requires 14 to 17 weekly sessions. PCIT techniques have been shown to increase compliance, decrease emotional outbursts (e.g., crying, blaming others, making excuses), improve the parent-child relationship, and even improve the child's self-esteem. During parent training, parents learn skills on how to manage their children's behavior, including:
    1.	Having special time with your child
    2.	Increasing parental attention to positive behavior
    3.	Using effective commands to increase compliance
    4.	Using positive reinforcements (privileges, point charts) to increase compliance
    5.	Using consistent consequences for inappropriate behavior
    6.	Learning how to ignore misbehavior and attend to appropriate behavior
    7.	Learning how to handle more severe, infrequent behaviors

## Parent Training for Adolescents 

- **Parent Training:** Childname’s parents would benefit from participation in an evidenced-based parent training program. Parenting management interventions have shown significant benefits for children with oppositional and conduct problems. In addition, findings suggest that parent training can improve parental functioning (e.g., decreased stress, enhanced competence). Childname’s parent is advised to choose from the following interventions. 
    - **Triple P:** a multi-level parent training program designed to address severe behavioral, emotional, and developmental problems in children by enhancing the knowledge, skills, and confidence of parents. Although the core programming focuses on parents of children ages 1 to 12 years, Triple P also extends to parents of teenagers.
    - **Kazdin Parent Management Training:** one of the most investigated treatments available for disruptive behavior, particularly oppositional defiant disorder. It has been shown to be effective in reducing child disruptive behavior and improving parental mental health. The main goal of Kazdin’s parent management training is to teach strategies that change the parent - child interaction pattern and avoid emotional outbursts in the family. 
    - **Parenting Wisely:** the only online-interactive parent education course for families that is currently listed on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Registry for Evidence-based Programs and Practices. Parenting Wisely has proven effective at reducing teen verbal and physical aggression, as well as improving effective parenting skills. 

## Behavioral Strategies for Selective Mutism

- **Behavioral Strategies for Selective Mutism:** Treatment for selective mutism uses specialized behavior therapy techniques that prompt speech and then reinforce successful speaking experiences with lots of labeled praise and small incentives.
    1. **Wait 5 seconds:** We often don’t give kids enough time to respond. Waiting five seconds without repeating the question or letting anyone answer for a child is a good rule of thumb. It also helps kids learn to tolerate their anxiety.
    2. **Use labeled praise:** Instead of just saying “Great job!” be specific: “Great job telling us you want juice!” This way kids know exactly what they’re being praised for, and they feel motivated to keep doing it.
    3. **Rephrase your question:** Instead of asking questions that can be answered with a yes or no — or, more often, nodding or shaking his/her head — ask a question that is more likely to prompt a verbal response. Try giving him/her choices (“Would you like a puppy sticker or a star sticker?”) or asking more open-ended questions (“What should we play next?”).
    4. **Practice echoing:** Repeat or paraphrase what the child is saying. This is reinforcing and lets him/her know that he/she has been heard and understood. For kids who speak very quietly, repeating what they say also helps them participate in bigger groups.
    5. **Be a sportscaster:** Do a play-by-play recap of what the child is doing: “You’re drawing a flower” or “I see you’re pointing to the picture in the book.” This helps convey interest in what the child is doing and is a good technique to fall back on when he/she is being nonverbal.

## Social Communication Skills Coaching

- **Social Communication Skills Coaching:** Social skills allow individuals to develop and maintain positive social relationships with peers, teachers, family, and community members. When individuals struggle with communication, problem-solving, self-management, and perspective-taking, it can interfere with social and academic development and functioning. Weaknesses in social skills can be understood as a skill or performance deficit, often improved by coaching and opportunities to practice skills. Behavioral skills training can address general social skills topics, such as verbal and non-verbal communication, making and maintaining friendships, problem-solving, perspective-taking, cooperative work/play, assertiveness, and effective responses to peer pressure and bullying. As such, the following strategies may be considered: 
    1. **Social skills groups** are designed to help children develop and practice social skills in a supportive therapeutic setting. Many children lack the necessary skills to navigate peer relationships. Social skills groups teach and provide practice for a child in the specific area with which they struggle. 
    2. **Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS®) for School-Age Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults:** An evidence-based social skills intervention for school-age and adolescents interested in learning ways to help them make and keep friends. It involves teaching youth ecologically valid social skills. That is, this approach involves teaching social behaviors that are naturally used by individuals who are social successfully. In other words, teaching individuals what actually works in reality. Certified PEERS providers can be found at: http://www2.semel.ucla.edu/peers/adolescents-certified-providers-usa or https://nyulangone.org/locations/child-study-center/peers-social-skills-program (clinician note: for school age kids to young adults)
    3. **FriendMaker App** (available for iPhone and iPad): This application helps individuals navigate social situations by practicing the skills taught in the PEERS® program
    4.	**Teach Social Narratives:** This website offers free pre-made social narratives to teach children about age-appropriate social topics, including crossing the street, rules about emailing, safety, following rules, expected behaviors, and personal space. Narratives can be found at: http://www.kansasasd.com/socialnarratives.php 
    5. **Teach Social Skills:** This free activity book, available online, is designed to teach social skills to children, particularly those with social difficulties. The underlying concept is that to proceed through the expected stages of their social development, children should possess all the skills addressed by this book, which can be found at: http://www.socialskillscentral.com/free/101_Ways_Teach_Children_Social_Skills.pdf
    6. **The Science of Making Friends:** *Helping Socially Challenged Teens and Young Adults* by Elizabeth Laugeson, Psy.D.: is the caregiver guide to the PEERS® program (available on Amazon). It also includes a DVD of role-play demonstrations of appropriate and inappropriate social behavior and exercises

# Psychopharmacology

## Standard Information

***Psychopharmacology***
Decisions regarding the use of medications in children are complex and are best made in consultation with a child and adolescent psychiatrist particularly given the co-occurring XX, XX, XX in {{CHILD-NAME}}’s case. We would recommend ongoing consultation with {{CHILD-NAME}}’s psychiatrist in medication monitoring.  Considerations for treatment are as follows:

## Psychopharmacology by Diagnosis

### ADHD

**Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder:**
Medications are commonly indicated for the treatment of ADHD.  Given the significant, and often immediate, effectiveness of ADHD medications, they can be considered as a treatment option at any stage of the disorder (including before any psychotherapy options).  If therapy is in place, ADHD medications can speed the pace of benefit from the therapy treatment by helping a child focus and learn in the treatment.  

Stimulant medications (e.g., methylphenidate or mixed amphetamine salts) are generally well-tolerated medications with high effectiveness rates.  Accordingly, these medications are considered “first-line” treatment for ADHD.  While stimulant medications are generally well tolerated, common side effects can include a decrease in appetite and insomnia. Although less common, there can also be increases in heart rate and blood pressure.  Accordingly, we recommend that all children who take stimulant medications be monitored routinely in their sleep, growth curves, and vital signs. It is also worth noting that sometimes when the medication “wears off,” a child may exhibit a return of ADHD symptoms or feel drowsy and moody for a short period of time. These are referred to as rebound symptoms.  Rebound symptoms can often be addressed with small increases in the medication dose or the addition of a “booster dose” to ensure more consistent coverage and a more gradual decrease in stimulant levels. 

Once on the correct dose, the effects of a stimulant can typically be seen within an hour of taking the medication, depending on the specific type used.  Because the effects are not additive over days, it is reasonable for many children to skip their stimulant medication on certain days (weekends or holidays) when they are not needed to help with focus; this is called a “medication holiday.”

For children who are unable to tolerate stimulant medications due to side effects, or have not had an optimal response to stimulants, a series of non-stimulant medications exist. Alpha-agonists (such as clonidine or guanfacine) are a class of medications that work on a different set of neurotransmitter (or brain chemical) systems known to be impacted in ADHD.  These medications can be safely given alone or in combination with stimulant medication and are generally well tolerated. Some children may feel mildly sleepy when starting or increasing medication doses with alpha agonists, but this usually resolves in a few days.   Although not commonly seen with the doses used to treat ADHD, these medications can lower blood pressure; as precaution, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate) are routinely monitored. Unlike stimulant medications, alpha-agonists can take several weeks to work and medication holidays are not recommended; missed doses can actually cause a worsening of symptoms.

Another non-stimulant medication in ADHD is atomoxetine.  Atomoxetine can be safely given alone or in combination with another ADHD medication.  This medication works differently than stimulants and alpha agonists and can require 4 to 6 weeks before effects are seen. A benefit of atomoxetine over stimulants is that its effects are around the clock, which could be beneficial for children who struggle in the morning before stimulants can begin to work or later at night when stimulant effects wear off. Common side effects for atomoxetine include stomach upset and dry mouth. Your doctor will likely monitor for a few rare but serious side effects (e.g., liver problems, development of suicidal thoughts). Unlike stimulant medications, medication holidays are not recommended; missed doses can actually cause a worsening of symptoms and, possibly, physical discomfort.

### Anxiety Disorders

#### Standard 

**Anxiety Disorders**
Children with anxiety disorders may benefit from medication treatment in addition to psychotherapy treatment.  This is especially true when anxiety symptoms are severe enough to interfere with a child’s ability to successfully participate in psychotherapy. The primary class of Food and Drug Association (FDA) approved anti-anxiety medications are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI; e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram).  SSRIs alter the activity of serotonin (a neurotransmitter or brain chemical).  There is evidence that many people with anxiety disorders have alterations in their serotonin activity that these medications can help improve symptoms.  SSRIs are typically well tolerated, are also FDA approved for treatment of depression, and can help with sad mood.  SSRIs typically take over a month to have maximal effect, but sometimes initial effects can be seen in the first weeks.  Because of this, it is very important to continue the medication as prescribed and neither miss doses nor give up too soon.  In teenagers and adults, one of the most common side effects is a decrease in libido and sexual functioning.  This can be hard or embarrassing for individuals to talk about with their doctors, so it is important that they are told about this possible side effect.  

For some individuals, SSRI medications can be too “activating”, resulting in excess motor activity, energy or impulsivity. Children should be monitored for this, as they may not be able to effectively report this on their own. In very rare instances, these medications have been reported to increase suicide thoughts; with proper monitoring, this side effect can be successfully detected and addressed.  Though SSRI medications are not addictive, the serotonin neurons adjust to the person taking the SSRI.  Because of this, children can feel sick if the medication is abruptly stopped.  We do not recommend stopping the SSRI medication without first discussing with the prescribing doctor.  

It is important to tell your child’s doctor about other medications that they are taking since SSRIs are known to interact with many other types of medication.  There are many anti-anxiety medications that are not SSRIs.  Your doctor may want to discuss these options if your child has a specific anxiety diagnosis that is known to respond to a different class of anti-anxiety medication or based on your child’s prior response to or tolerability of SSRIs.

Medications can be helpful in treatment of anxiety disorders and can be considered as part of an initial treatment plan. However, it is often reasonable to attempt psychotherapeutic intervention without medication first.  Should {{CHILD-NAME}}’s anxiety worsen to the point that it is further impairing and not responsive to behavioral intervention, medication options could be considered. The primary class of Food and Drug Association (FDA) approved anti-anxiety medications are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI; e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram). We would recommend that a child and adolescent psychiatrist be consulted prior to initiation of any medications.

#### Lower Severity

Medications can be helpful in treatment of anxiety disorders and can be considered as part of an initial treatment plan.  However, it is often reasonable to attempt psychotherapeutic intervention without medication first.  Should {{CHILD-NAME}}’s anxiety worsen to the point that it is further impairing and not responsive to behavioral intervention, medication options could be considered.

### Depression and Anxiety

**Depression and Anxiety**
Children with depressive and anxiety disorders may benefit from medication treatment in addition to psychotherapy treatment. The primary class of Food and Drug Association (FDA) approved anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medications are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI; e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram).  SSRIs alter the activity of serotonin (a neurotransmitter or brain chemical).  There is evidence that many people with depressive and anxiety disorders have alterations in their serotonin activity that these medications can help improve symptoms.  SSRIs are typically well tolerated.  SSRIs typically take over a month to have maximal effect, but sometimes initial effects can be seen in the first weeks. Because of this, it is very important to continue the medication as prescribed and neither miss doses nor give up too soon. In teenagers and adults, one of the most common side effects is a decrease in libido and sexual functioning.  This can be hard or embarrassing for individuals to talk about with their doctors, so it is important that they are told about this possible side effect.  

For some individuals, SNRI and SSRI medications can be too “activating”, resulting in excess motor activity, energy or impulsivity. Teens should be monitored for this, as they may not be able to effectively report this on their own. In very rare instances, these medications have been reported to increase suicide thoughts; with proper monitoring, this side effect can be successfully detected and addressed.  Though SNRI and SSRI medications are not addictive, the serotonin neurons adjust to the person taking the SSRI.  Because of this, teens can feel sick if the medication is abruptly stopped.  We do not recommend stopping the SSRI or SNRI medication without first discussing with the prescribing doctor.  

It is important to tell your child’s doctor about other medications that they are taking since SSRIs are known to interact with many other types of medication.

### OCD

**OCD**
Children with OCD may benefit from medication treatment in addition to psychotherapy treatment. This is especially true when anxiety symptoms are severe enough to interfere with a child’s ability to successfully participate in psychotherapy. The primary class of Food and Drug Association (FDA) approved OCD medications are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI; e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram). SSRIs alter the activity of serotonin (a neurotransmitter or brain chemical). There is evidence that many people with anxiety disorders have alterations in their serotonin activity that these medications can help improve symptoms.

### Enuresis

**Enuresis**
There is no known medication that cures enuresis; however, medications can treat symptoms. When the drug is stopped, the enuresis will usually return unless the child has naturally outgrown it. Two commonly used medications are Tofranil (imipramine) and DDAVP (desmopressin acetate).  These could be discussed with {{CHILD-NAME}}’s doctor should he/she fail to respond to behavioral interventions for enuresis.

### IED

#### IED and ADHD

**Temper Outbursts:** Temper outbursts are common in children with ADHD. Often treatment of the ADHD is sufficient to substantially decrease temper outbursts. At present, no specific pharmacologic treatment are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of Intermittent Explosive Disorder in children.  Accordingly, we recommend utilizing psychotherapeutic interventions coupled to school-based supportive approaches as a first line intervention.  Should {{CHILD-NAME}} continue to experience distressing and impairing symptoms despite treatment of ADHD, optimal psychotherapeutic and school-based interventions, and medication interventions to help improve symptoms can be considered.

#### IED without ADHD 

**Temper Outbursts:** At present, no specific pharmacologic treatment are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of Intermittent Explosive Disorder in children.  However, medication treatment can be beneficial for some children in decreasing temper outbursts. Often, as children develop, they become better able to control their impulses. As a result, if medications are considered, we recommend consideration of intermittent medication reductions to see if they continue to be required. These types of medications considerations are best made in context of utilizing psychotherapeutic interventions and in consultation with a child and adolescent psychiatrist. We do not see current evidence for {{CHILD-NAME}} past diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, if this were determined in longitudinal clinical evaluation, treatment of the ADHD may improve impulse regulation.

### Anxiety and Outbursts - Try Therapy First

Treating anxiety and emotional outbursts can sometimes necessitate psychopharmacological treatment. Decisions regarding the use of medications for psychiatric indications are complex and best made in consultation with a child psychiatrist.  Children with anxiety disorders may benefit from medication treatment in addition to psychotherapy treatment.  This is especially true when anxiety symptoms are severe enough to interfere with a child’s ability to successfully participate in psychotherapy.  At this time, however, we would recommend first implementing cognitive behavioral therapy and parent training targeting {{CHILD-NAME}}’s social anxiety and temper outbursts.  Should his/her anxiety symptoms persist despite an appropriate psychotherapy trial, medication could be considered in consultation with a child psychiatrist.
 
### Tics

**Tics:** With respect to {{CHILD-NAME}}’s tic disorder, should {{CHILD-NAME}}’s tic symptoms persist or intensify despite appropriate psychotherapeutic intervention (such as CBIT), medication intervention can be helpful and could be considered in consultation with a child psychiatrist. Alpha-agonist medications can help in improving tic symptoms.  Other medication options also exist but we would defer to discussion with a child and adolescent psychiatrist in helping {{CHILD-NAME}} and his/her family weigh benefits against potential risks.
  

### ADHD: 5-year-old

**Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder:** Medications are commonly indicated for the treatment of ADHD.  Given the significant, and often immediate, effectiveness of ADHD medications, they can be considered as a treatment option at any stage of the disorder (including before any psychotherapy options).  If therapy is in place, ADHD medications can speed the pace of benefit from the therapy treatment by helping a child focus and learn in the treatment.  

Stimulant medications (e.g., methylphenidate or mixed amphetamine salts) are generally well-tolerated medications with high effectiveness rates.  Accordingly, these medications are considered “first-line” treatment for ADHD.  Young children may experience less tolerability.  While stimulant medications are generally well tolerated regardless of age, common side effects can include decrease in appetite and insomnia. Although less common, there can also be increases in heart rate and blood pressure.  Accordingly, we recommend that all children who take stimulant medications be monitored routinely in their sleep, growth curves and vital signs. It is also worth noting that sometimes when the medication “wears off”, a child may exhibit a return of ADHD symptoms or feel drowsy and moody for a short period of time. These are referred to as rebound symptoms.  Rebound symptoms can often be addressed with small increases in the medication dose or the addition of a “booster dose” to ensure more consistent coverage and a more gradual decrease in stimulant levels. 

Once on the correct dose, the effects of a stimulant can typically be seen within an hour of taking the medication, depending on the specific type used.  Because the effects are not additive over days, it is reasonable for many children to skip their stimulant medication on certain days (weekends or holidays) when they are not needed to help with focus; this is called a “medication holiday”. 

### DMDD

**Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder:** As DMDD was just recently defined in the most up to date version of the diagnostic manual used by clinicians (i.e., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; DSM 5), there are yet to be medications with specific indications for the disorder. Typically, clinicians will first work to identify any co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety disorders or ADHD, and treat them accordingly. If symptoms persist, then based upon clinical experience, a number of medication options exist, which can help. Among those with lesser side effect profiles are SSRIs and alpha agonists (e.g., guanfacine, clonidine). At times, when these options are not fully effective, other treatments, such as mood stabilizers and neuroleptic medications may be considered. Use of any psychiatric medication should be done in close coordination with a psychiatrist, and like any medication, careful monitoring for and reporting of potential side effects is essential.

## Substance Abstinence 

**Substance Abstinence**
It is critical that {{CHILD-NAME}} abstain from alcohol, cigarettes and illicit substance use, including marijuana, when using medication.  Use of these substances can add to low motivation and poor attention and focus.  These substances may also interact with medications, either directly or indirectly, making {{CHILD-NAME}} more prone to development of medication side effects and rendering the prescribed medications less effective.

# Further Evaluations

## ASD Developmental Evaluations

***Further Evaluation***
**Developmental Evaluation/Evaluation to Assess for Autism Spectrum Disorder:** A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation performed by a psychologist specializing in autism spectrum disorders should be considered. These evaluations use well-validated and substantiated measures, including the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule – Second Edition (ADOS-2) currently considered the gold standard in autism assessment, the Autism Diagnostic Interview – Revised (ADI-R), and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale – Second Edition (CARS – 2). Diagnoses and recommendations for home- and school-based interventions are made based on direct observation and interaction, interviews, and available records.

## Elimination Disorders - Follow-up with Pediatrician

### Encopresis

***Further Evaluation***
**Follow-up with Pediatrician:** {{CHILD-NAME}} exhibits continued toileting accidents at a frequency warranting diagnosis of encopresis. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s pediatrician should be consulted to revisit the question of a physical cause and refer to a urologist. If symptoms persist, behavioral strategies may be considered. However, behavioral intervention does not take the place of obtaining a full medical workup to rule out health problems.

### Enuresis

***Further Evaluation***
**Follow-up with Pediatrician:** {{CHILD-NAME}} exhibits continued toileting accidents at a frequency warranting a diagnosis of enuresis. As such, further investigation into medical causes or complications should be undertaken. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s pediatrician should be consulted to revisit the question of a physical cause and refer to a urologist. If symptoms persist, behavioral strategies (e.g., bell and pad, terminating fluid intake, prompting to use the restroom during the night) may be considered. However, behavioral intervention does not take the place of obtaining a full medical workup to rule out health problems.

## IDD and Borderline - Vineland not administered

***Further Evaluation***
**Adaptive Behavior Evaluation:** In order to provide a confirmed diagnosis of Intellectual Developmental Disorder, an evaluation of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s adaptive behavior is required. These evaluations use well-validated and standardized measures, such as the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales – Third Edition (Vineland-3) or the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System – Third Edition (ABAS-3).

## Neurological - Psychosis

***Further Evaluation***
**Neurological/Medical Evaluation:** {{CHILD-NAME}}’s experience of hearing and seeing things that others cannot (e.g. psychosis) is concerning for several potential neurological conditions. We would recommend that {{CHILD-NAME}} and his/her family consult with a child neurologist to evaluate more thoroughly for neurological conditions that could cause or contribute to his/her acute psychosis.   He/she also requires a thorough medical evaluation.  

## Sensory Vulnerabilities

***Further Evaluation***
**Occupational Therapy (OT):** Occupational therapy can help kids with sensory issues feel less overwhelmed, learn how to self-regulate and cope with challenging situations. Specialists work with kids who have sensory issues by using sensory integration therapy in special gyms. The idea is that through physical contact and movements like spinning, crashing and jumping, the child can experience an optimal level of arousal and regulation.
