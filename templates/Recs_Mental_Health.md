## Standard Information

***Psychopharmacology***
Decisions regarding the use of medications in children are complex and are best made in consultation with a child and adolescent psychiatrist particularly given the co-occurring XX, XX, XX in Childname’s case. We would recommend ongoing consultation with Childname’s psychiatrist in medication monitoring.  Considerations for treatment are as follows:

## Psychopharmacology by Diagnosis

### ADHD

**Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder:**
Medications are commonly indicated for the treatment of ADHD.  Given the significant, and often immediate, effectiveness of ADHD medications, they can be considered as a treatment option at any stage of the disorder (including before any psychotherapy options).  If therapy is in place, ADHD medications can speed the pace of benefit from the therapy treatment by helping a child focus and learn in the treatment.  

Stimulant medications (e.g., methylphenidate or mixed amphetamine salts) are generally well-tolerated medications with high effectiveness rates.  Accordingly, these medications are considered “first-line” treatment for ADHD.  While stimulant medications are generally well tolerated, common side effects can include a decrease in appetite and insomnia. Although less common, there can also be increases in heart rate and blood pressure.  Accordingly, we recommend that all children who take stimulant medications be monitored routinely in their sleep, growth curves, and vital signs. It is also worth noting that sometimes when the medication “wears off,” a child may exhibit a return of ADHD symptoms or feel drowsy and moody for a short period of time. These are referred to as rebound symptoms.  Rebound symptoms can often be addressed with small increases in the medication dose or the addition of a “booster dose” to ensure more consistent coverage and a more gradual decrease in stimulant levels. 

Once on the correct dose, the effects of a stimulant can typically be seen within an hour of taking the medication, depending on the specific type used.  Because the effects are not additive over days, it is reasonable for many children to skip their stimulant medication on certain days (weekends or holidays) when they are not needed to help with focus; this is called a “medication holiday.”

For children who are unable to tolerate stimulant medications due to side effects, or have not had an optimal response to stimulants, a series of non-stimulant medications exist. Alpha-agonists (such as clonidine or guanfacine) are a class of medications that work on a different set of neurotransmitter (or brain chemical) systems known to be impacted in ADHD.  These medications can be safely given alone or in combination with stimulant medication and are generally well tolerated. Some children may feel mildly sleepy when starting or increasing medication doses with alpha agonists, but this usually resolves in a few days.   Although not commonly seen with the doses used to treat ADHD, these medications can lower blood pressure; as precaution, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate) are routinely monitored. Unlike stimulant medications, alpha-agonists can take several weeks to work and medication holidays are not recommended; missed doses can actually cause a worsening of symptoms.

Another non-stimulant medication in ADHD is atomoxetine.  Atomoxetine can be safely given alone or in combination with another ADHD medication.  This medication works differently than stimulants and alpha agonists and can require 4 to 6 weeks before effects are seen. A benefit of atomoxetine over stimulants is that its effects are around the clock, which could be beneficial for children who struggle in the morning before stimulants can begin to work or later at night when stimulant effects wear off. Common side effects for atomoxetine include stomach upset and dry mouth. Your doctor will likely monitor for a few rare but serious side effects (e.g., liver problems, development of suicidal thoughts). Unlike stimulant medications, medication holidays are not recommended; missed doses can actually cause a worsening of symptoms and, possibly, physical discomfort.

### Anxiety Disorders

#### Standard 

**Anxiety Disorders**
Children with anxiety disorders may benefit from medication treatment in addition to psychotherapy treatment.  This is especially true when anxiety symptoms are severe enough to interfere with a child’s ability to successfully participate in psychotherapy. The primary class of Food and Drug Association (FDA) approved anti-anxiety medications are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI; e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram).  SSRIs alter the activity of serotonin (a neurotransmitter or brain chemical).  There is evidence that many people with anxiety disorders have alterations in their serotonin activity that these medications can help improve symptoms.  SSRIs are typically well tolerated, are also FDA approved for treatment of depression, and can help with sad mood.  SSRIs typically take over a month to have maximal effect, but sometimes initial effects can be seen in the first weeks.  Because of this, it is very important to continue the medication as prescribed and neither miss doses nor give up too soon.  In teenagers and adults, one of the most common side effects is a decrease in libido and sexual functioning.  This can be hard or embarrassing for individuals to talk about with their doctors, so it is important that they are told about this possible side effect.  

For some individuals, SSRI medications can be too “activating”, resulting in excess motor activity, energy or impulsivity. Children should be monitored for this, as they may not be able to effectively report this on their own. In very rare instances, these medications have been reported to increase suicide thoughts; with proper monitoring, this side effect can be successfully detected and addressed.  Though SSRI medications are not addictive, the serotonin neurons adjust to the person taking the SSRI.  Because of this, children can feel sick if the medication is abruptly stopped.  We do not recommend stopping the SSRI medication without first discussing with the prescribing doctor.  

It is important to tell your child’s doctor about other medications that they are taking since SSRIs are known to interact with many other types of medication.  There are many anti-anxiety medications that are not SSRIs.  Your doctor may want to discuss these options if your child has a specific anxiety diagnosis that is known to respond to a different class of anti-anxiety medication or based on your child’s prior response to or tolerability of SSRIs.

Medications can be helpful in treatment of anxiety disorders and can be considered as part of an initial treatment plan. However, it is often reasonable to attempt psychotherapeutic intervention without medication first.  Should Childname’s anxiety worsen to the point that it is further impairing and not responsive to behavioral intervention, medication options could be considered. The primary class of Food and Drug Association (FDA) approved anti-anxiety medications are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI; e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram). We would recommend that a child and adolescent psychiatrist be consulted prior to initiation of any medications.

#### Lower Severity

Medications can be helpful in treatment of anxiety disorders and can be considered as part of an initial treatment plan.  However, it is often reasonable to attempt psychotherapeutic intervention without medication first.

### Depression and Anxiety

**Depression and Anxiety**
Children with depressive and anxiety disorders may benefit from medication treatment in addition to psychotherapy treatment. The primary class of Food and Drug Association (FDA) approved anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medications are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI; e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram).  SSRIs alter the activity of serotonin (a neurotransmitter or brain chemical).  There is evidence that many people with depressive and anxiety disorders have alterations in their serotonin activity that these medications can help improve symptoms.  SSRIs are typically well tolerated.  SSRIs typically take over a month to have maximal effect, but sometimes initial effects can be seen in the first weeks. Because of this, it is very important to continue the medication as prescribed and neither miss doses nor give up too soon. In teenagers and adults, one of the most common side effects is a decrease in libido and sexual functioning.  This can be hard or embarrassing for individuals to talk about with their doctors, so it is important that they are told about this possible side effect.  

For some individuals, SNRI and SSRI medications can be too “activating”, resulting in excess motor activity, energy or impulsivity. Teens should be monitored for this, as they may not be able to effectively report this on their own. In very rare instances, these medications have been reported to increase suicide thoughts; with proper monitoring, this side effect can be successfully detected and addressed.  Though SNRI and SSRI medications are not addictive, the serotonin neurons adjust to the person taking the SSRI.  Because of this, teens can feel sick if the medication is abruptly stopped.  We do not recommend stopping the SSRI or SNRI medication without first discussing with the prescribing doctor.  

It is important to tell your child’s doctor about other medications that they are taking since SSRIs are known to interact with many other types of medication.

### OCD

**OCD**
Children with OCD may benefit from medication treatment in addition to psychotherapy treatment. This is especially true when anxiety symptoms are severe enough to interfere with a child’s ability to successfully participate in psychotherapy. The primary class of Food and Drug Association (FDA) approved OCD medications are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI; e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram). SSRIs alter the activity of serotonin (a neurotransmitter or brain chemical). There is evidence that many people with anxiety disorders have alterations in their serotonin activity that these medications can help improve symptoms. SSRIs are typically well tolerated, are also FDA approved for treatment of depression, and can help with sad mood. SSRIs typically take over a month to have maximal effect, but sometimes initial effects can be seen in the first weeks.

### Enuresis

**Enuresis**
There is no known medication that cures enuresis; however, medications can treat symptoms. When the drug is stopped, the enuresis will usually return unless the child has naturally outgrown it. Two commonly used medications are Tofranil (imipramine) and DDAVP (desmopressin acetate).  These could be discussed with Childname’s doctor should he/she fail to respond to behavioral interventions for enuresis.

### IED

#### IED and ADHD

**Temper Outbursts:** Temper outbursts are common in children with ADHD. Often treatment of the ADHD is sufficient to substantially decrease temper outbursts. At present, no specific pharmacologic treatment are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of Intermittent Explosive Disorder in children.  Accordingly, we recommend utilizing psychotherapeutic interventions coupled to school-based supportive approaches as a first line intervention.  Should Childname continue to experience distressing and impairing symptoms despite treatment of ADHD, optimal psychotherapeutic and school-based interventions, and medication interventions to help improve symptoms can be considered.

#### IED without ADHD 

**Temper Outbursts:** At present, no specific pharmacologic treatment are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of Intermittent Explosive Disorder in children.  However, medication treatment can be beneficial for some children in decreasing temper outbursts. Often, as children develop, they become better able to control their impulses. As a result, if medications are considered, we recommend consideration of intermittent medication reductions to see if they continue to be required. These types of medications considerations are best made in context of utilizing psychotherapeutic interventions and in consultation with a child and adolescent psychiatrist. We do not see current evidence for Childname past diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, if this were determined in longitudinal clinical evaluation, treatment of the ADHD may improve impulse regulation.

### Anxiety and Outbursts - Try Therapy First

Treating anxiety and emotional outbursts can sometimes necessitate psychopharmacological treatment. Decisions regarding the use of medications for psychiatric indications are complex and best made in consultation with a child psychiatrist.  Children with anxiety disorders may benefit from medication treatment in addition to psychotherapy treatment.  This is especially true when anxiety symptoms are severe enough to interfere with a child’s ability to successfully participate in psychotherapy.  At this time, however, we would recommend first implementing cognitive behavioral therapy and parent training targeting Childname’s social anxiety and temper outbursts.  Should his/her anxiety symptoms persist despite an appropriate psychotherapy trial, medication could be considered in consultation with a child psychiatrist.
 
### Tics

**Tics:** With respect to Childname’s tic disorder, should Childname’s tic symptoms persist or intensify despite appropriate psychotherapeutic intervention (such as CBIT), medication intervention can be helpful and could be considered in consultation with a child psychiatrist. Alpha-agonist medications can help in improving tic symptoms.  Other medication options also exist but we would defer to discussion with a child and adolescent psychiatrist in helping Childname and his/her family weigh benefits against potential risks.
  

### ADHD: 5-year-old

**Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder:** Medications are commonly indicated for the treatment of ADHD.  Given the significant, and often immediate, effectiveness of ADHD medications, they can be considered as a treatment option at any stage of the disorder (including before any psychotherapy options).  If therapy is in place, ADHD medications can speed the pace of benefit from the therapy treatment by helping a child focus and learn in the treatment.  

Stimulant medications (e.g., methylphenidate or mixed amphetamine salts) are generally well-tolerated medications with high effectiveness rates.  Accordingly, these medications are considered “first-line” treatment for ADHD.  Young children may experience less tolerability.  While stimulant medications are generally well tolerated regardless of age, common side effects can include decrease in appetite and insomnia. Although less common, there can also be increases in heart rate and blood pressure.  Accordingly, we recommend that all children who take stimulant medications be monitored routinely in their sleep, growth curves and vital signs. It is also worth noting that sometimes when the medication “wears off”, a child may exhibit a return of ADHD symptoms or feel drowsy and moody for a short period of time. These are referred to as rebound symptoms.  Rebound symptoms can often be addressed with small increases in the medication dose or the addition of a “booster dose” to ensure more consistent coverage and a more gradual decrease in stimulant levels. 

Once on the correct dose, the effects of a stimulant can typically be seen within an hour of taking the medication, depending on the specific type used.  Because the effects are not additive over days, it is reasonable for many children to skip their stimulant medication on certain days (weekends or holidays) when they are not needed to help with focus; this is called a “medication holiday”. 

### DMDD

**Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder:** As DMDD was just recently defined in the most up to date version of the diagnostic manual used by clinicians (i.e., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; DSM 5), there are yet to be medications with specific indications for the disorder. Typically, clinicians will first work to identify any co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety disorders or ADHD, and treat them accordingly. If symptoms persist, then based upon clinical experience, a number of medication options exist, which can help. Among those with lesser side effect profiles are SSRIs and alpha agonists (e.g., guanfacine, clonidine). At times, when these options are not fully effective, other treatments, such as mood stabilizers and neuroleptic medications may be considered. Use of any psychiatric medication should be done in close coordination with a psychiatrist, and like any medication, careful monitoring for and reporting of potential side effects is essential.

## Substance Abstinence 

**Substance Abstinence**
It is critical that Childname abstain from alcohol, cigarettes and illicit substance use, including marijuana, when using medication.  Use of these substances can add to low motivation and poor attention and focus.  These substances may also interact with medications, either directly or indirectly, making Childname more prone to development of medication side effects and rendering the prescribed medications less effective.

# Further Evaluations

## ASD Developmental Evaluations

***Further Evaluation***
**Developmental Evaluation/Evaluation to Assess for Autism Spectrum Disorder:** A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation performed by a psychologist specializing in autism spectrum disorders should be considered. These evaluations use well-validated and substantiated measures, including the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule – Second Edition (ADOS-2) currently considered the gold standard in autism assessment, the Autism Diagnostic Interview – Revised (ADI-R), and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale – Second Edition (CARS – 2). Diagnoses and recommendations for home- and school-based interventions are made based on direct observation and interaction, interviews, and available records.

## Elimination Disorders - Follow-up with Pediatrician

### Encopresis

***Further Evaluation***
**Follow-up with Pediatrician:** Childname exhibits continued toileting accidents at a frequency warranting diagnosis of encopresis. Childname’s pediatrician should be consulted to revisit the question of a physical cause and refer to a urologist. If symptoms persist, behavioral strategies may be considered. However, behavioral intervention does not take the place of obtaining a full medical workup to rule out health problems.

### Enuresis

***Further Evaluation***
**Follow-up with Pediatrician:** Childname exhibits continued toileting accidents at a frequency warranting a diagnosis of enuresis. As such, further investigation into medical causes or complications should be undertaken. Childname’s pediatrician should be consulted to revisit the question of a physical cause and refer to a urologist. If symptoms persist, behavioral strategies (e.g., bell and pad, terminating fluid intake, prompting to use the restroom during the night) may be considered. However, behavioral intervention does not take the place of obtaining a full medical workup to rule out health problems.

## IDD and Borderline - Vineland not administered

***Further Evaluation***
**Adaptive Behavior Evaluation:** In order to provide a confirmed diagnosis of Intellectual Developmental Disorder, an evaluation of Childname’s adaptive behavior is required. These evaluations use well-validated and standardized measures, such as the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales – Third Edition (Vineland-3) or the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System – Third Edition (ABAS-3).

## Neurological - Psychosis

***Further Evaluation***
**Neurological/Medical Evaluation:** Childname’s experience of hearing and seeing things that others cannot (e.g. psychosis) is concerning for several potential neurological conditions. We would recommend that Childname and his/her family consult with a child neurologist to evaluate more thoroughly for neurological conditions that could cause or contribute to his/her acute psychosis.   He/she also requires a thorough medical evaluation.  

## Sensory Vulnerabilities

***Further Evaluation***
**Occupational Therapy (OT):** Occupational therapy can help kids with sensory issues feel less overwhelmed, learn how to self-regulate and cope with challenging situations. Specialists work with kids who have sensory issues by using sensory integration therapy in special gyms. The idea is that through physical contact and movements like spinning, crashing and jumping, the child can experience an optimal level of arousal and regulation.
