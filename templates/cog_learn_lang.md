# Caveats

## Hyperactivity

### Valid

Testing was completed over the course of 3 sessions to gain insight into {{CHILD-NAME}}’s cognitive and academic profile. Testing behavioral observations revealed difficulty sustaining attention and an impulsive response style. However, considering {{CHILD-NAME}}’s positive response to redirection and the structure of the one-to-one environment, the results of this evaluation are considered a valid assessment of {{PRONOUN-2}} functioning.

### Underestimate

Testing behavioral observations revealed difficulty tolerating frustration and significant hyperactivity. Although {{CHILD_NAME}} responded very well to the redirection and the structure of the one- to –one environment, often his/her behaviors interfered with his/her ability to engage effectively in the tasks. As such, the results of this evaluation may represent an underestimate of his/her true ability.

## No Meds

### Valid

Cognitive, language, neurocognitive and academic testing was completed over the course of three sessions, to gain insight into {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile of strengths and weaknesses. Testing behavioral observations revealed very good response to structure and the one to one testing environment. Despite not taking {{PRONOUN-2}} prescribed stimulant medication, {{CHILD-NAME}} was easily engaged in testing and took a careful approach. Thus, {{PRONOUN-2}} performance represents a valid indication of {{PRONOUN-2}} ability.

### Underestimate

Testing was completed over the course of 3 sessions to gain insight into {{CHILD-NAME}}’s cognitive, academic and neurocognitive profile. {{CHILD-NAME}} was not administered {{PRONOUN-2}} medication on the days of the testing. Behavioral observations revealed irritable mood and variable effort which at times interfered with {{PRONOUN-2}} performance, likely making the current assessment a mild underestimate of {{PRONOUN-2}} cognitive potential.

## Inconsistent Instruction

It is important to note that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reading instruction has been extremely inconsistent, due to behavioral and emotional challenges in the school setting.

## Anxiety with Timed Tasks

It is important to note that both the visual spatial and processing speed tasks are timed; considering {{CHILD-NAME}}’s observed anxiety during speeded tasks, it is likely that nervousness attenuated {{PRONOUN-2}} performance in this domain.

## Shy and Low Frustration Tolerance

Behavioral observations revealed {{CHILD-NAME}} to be very shy and reluctant to provide verbal responses. Furthermore, {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated a very low tolerance for frustration, often displaying self-directed and avoidant behavior when presented with tasks {{PRONOUN-0}} perceived as difficult. Often {{PRONOUN-2}} behaviors interfered with {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to engage effectively in the tasks. As such, the results of this evaluation may represent an underestimate of {{PRONOUN-2}} true ability and should be interpreted with caution, especially the more verbally loaded tasks.

## Attempting WISC-V and doing KBIT-2

Typically, participants who are six to fifteen years of age complete the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V). Although the WISC-V was initially attempted, {{CHILD-NAME}} significantly struggled with heavy language-based demands of this measure. As a result of these difficulties, the WISC-V was prematurely discontinued, and alternatively, the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition (KBIT-2) was administered.

## Age Norms Used for Child Repeating a Grade

It is important to note that age norms were used despite {{CHILD-NAME}} repeating kindergarten as a child; thus, {{CHILD-NAME}} has been exposed to less academic material than other children {{PRONOUN-2}} age and comparing {{PRONOUN-1}} to grade level peers may produce slightly higher scores.

## Untestable participant

Testing was attempted over the course of one session to gain insight into {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall intellectual ability, language, neurocognitive, and academic skills. However, due to {{CHILD-NAME}}’s interfering behavioral difficulties, as described above, standardized testing ultimately could not be completed. Although the WISC-V would typically be administered as a measure to gain insight into {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall level of general intellectual function, due to the significant language demands of the WISC-V it was determined this would not be an effective measure of attaining {{PRONOUN-2}} intellectual functioning. As such, the KBIT-2, a brief measure of overall intellectual functioning with less language demands, was subsequently attempted. However, as {{CHILD-NAME}} was nonresponsive after the first two items administered, testing was again discontinued. Similarly, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic and language achievement was not formally assessed during this evaluation. Tasks from the WIAT-4 were attempted; however testing was discontinued after four tasks due to {{CHILD-NAME}}’s difficulty understanding task directions and interfering behaviors.

## Bilingual

### standard

It is important to note that {{CHILD-NAME}} is bilingual in X and X, and although {{PRONOUN-2}} dominant language is reported to be English, {{PRONOUN-0}} differs linguistically and culturally from the normative population. Therefore, {{PRONOUN-2}} scores on language tests with high cultural and linguistic demands likely reflect different exposure to language than a monolingual student.

### Dual Lang Curriculum and Inattentive/Bx Dysreg

It is important to note that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance on the current evaluation may have been impacted by {{PRONOUN-2}} exposure to a dual-language curriculum (i.e., Language/Language). Further, the measures administered as part of this research protocol do not provide clear indication of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s primary language. These limitations prevent us from confidently determining the true nature of the existing academic weaknesses. Given that behavioral dysregulation, particularly inattention, appears to be an additional prominent concern with which {{CHILD-NAME}} is presenting, a follow-up assessment is recommended after 6-8 months of intensive treatment for symptoms of inattention. After being provided with interventions that effectively manage symptoms related to behavioral dysregulation, particularly inattention, if {{CHILD-NAME}} continues to struggle with adequately accessing the curriculum, it will be critical that {{PRONOUN-0}} complete a more specialized evaluation, particularly one that considers the impact of {{PRONOUN-2}} dual-language academic setting.

## Hearing Loss

Due to {{CHILD-NAME}}’s bilateral hearing loss, testing accommodations were made to optimize {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to attend to auditory stimuli, whenever possible. Despite accommodations it is important to note that the administered tests were not geared toward children with hearing impairments.

## Visual Impairment

Due to {{CHILD-NAME}}’s aforementioned visual impairment, testing accommodations were made to optimize {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to attend to visual stimuli, whenever possible. Despite accommodations, it is important to note that the administered tests were not standardized for children with visual impairments and thus caution is required when interpreting results of visual and spatially related measures.

## Hx of Lang Deficits

PLEASE BE ADVISED: As part of the current evaluation, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s cognitive functioning was assessed using the WISC-V/WAIS-IV. Given {{CHILD-NAME}}’s history of fundamental core language deficits (to be discussed in more detail later in this report), as well as the heavy language demands of the WISC-V/WAIS-IV, this test may not be the most appropriate measure to evaluate {{CHILD-NAME}}’s cognitive potential. However, results may be a true representation of {{PRONOUN-2}} cognitive functioning when working on tasks and in settings with heavy language-based demands, such as {{PRONOUN-2}} classroom.

## Language Delays, Did Not Understand Directions

Behavioral observations revealed {{CHILD-NAME}} to be highly cooperative and agreeable; however, {{PRONOUN-2}} severe language delays and difficulty regulating {{PRONOUN-2}} attention interfered with {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to participate in the fixed battery administered in the current evaluation. On the KBIT-2, a brief measure of overall intellectual functioning, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s Full Scale IQ was in the ‘lower extreme range.’ However, due to {{PRONOUN-2}} difficulty understanding task demands and expressing {{PRONOUN-2}} answers, these results were not considered valid and likely represent an underestimate of {{PRONOUN-2}} cognitive functioning.

## Recent Previous Testing

### DOE Evaluation <6 Months Prior

\*PLEASE BE ADVISED: As part of the current evaluation, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s cognitive/academic functioning was assessed using the WISC-V/WAIS-IV/WIAT-4. However, it is important to note that XX months (MONTH YEAR) prior to {{PRONOUN-2}} participation in the HBN research study, {{CHILD-NAME}} was administered the WISC-V/WAIS-IV/WIAT-4 as part of a DOE evaluation. It is a professional assessment standard that cognitive measures are not administered more than once every 6 months to prevent practice effects. As such, due to the close proximity between administrations the WISC-V/WAIS-IV/WIAT-4, the WISC-V/WAIS-IV/WIAT-4 results from the current evaluation need to be cautiously considered and may not be a true and valid representation of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s individual functioning. Nonetheless, with the exception of the WISC-V/WAIS-IV/WIAT-4 results, the cognitive/academic, neurocognitive, fine motor, language, and phonological processing results of this evaluation are considered to be a realistic depiction of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s functioning.

### Standard < 12 Months Prior

\*PLEASE BE ADVISED: In MONTH YEAR, {{CHILD-NAME}} participated in an evaluation that included the WISC-V/WAIS-IV. As part of the current evaluation, {{CHILD-NAME}} was re-administered the WISC-V/WAIS-IV/WIAT-4. Repeated administrations—those that take place less than twelve months apart—of a standardized measure can result in scores that are inflated; this is known as practice effects. As a result of the close proximity between administrations, the WISC-V/WAIS-IV/WIAT-4 results from the current evaluation may be falsely inflated and need to be cautiously considered.

## Young Examinees/Possible Inflated Scores on WIAT

### Put Before Results:

\*PLEASE BE ADVISED: While standardized tests are highly beneficial to compare children’s skills to those of their same aged peers, it is often harder to interpret the skills of younger children, such as {{CHILD-NAME}}’s. For example, based on the norms for a child in {{CHILD-NAME}}’s age range, {{PRONOUN-0}} can get none of the items correct and still earn a standard score at or near age expectation.

### Put After the Results:

Given the combination of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s difficulties with completing the assessment items, {{PRONOUN-2}} longstanding behavioral difficulties, and emerging academic struggles, it seems that the standard scores, even those that are below normal limits, inflate {{PRONOUN-2}} current level of academic skill. Thus, the results generated from standardized tests are not able to provide a complete and meaningful picture of {{PRONOUN-2}} academic skills. As {{PRONOUN-0}} transitions to kindergarten, it will be critical that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s academic skills be carefully monitored. If {{PRONOUN-0}} struggles, it will be imperative that {{PRONOUN-0}} be immediately provided with effective intervention.

## Extended Testing Period

Please be advised, testing throughout the course of this evaluation was conducted over an extended period of time. Notably, the WISC-V/WAIS-IV, WIAT-4, CTOPP-2, TOWRE-2, and CELF-5 screener were given in MONTH YEAR (list month/year for all clinical components). Thus, the following results reflect {{CHILD-NAME}}’s functioning at that time and are not representative of any changes which may have occurred over the course of their participation in the study.

# KBIT-2 Summaries

## Standard Template

Testing was completed over the course of X sessions, to gain insight into {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall intellectual ability, language, neurocognition and academic skills.

As measured by the KBIT-2, a brief measure of overall intellectual functioning, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) score placed within the **\_\_** range of functioning, suggesting **\_\_** foundational cognitive reasoning abilities. Given the variability between the Verbal Composite score and the Nonverbal Composite, the FSIQ needs to be carefully considered. That is, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s score placed within the **\_\_** range on the Verbal Composite, indicating **\_\_** verbal concept formation, reasoning ability, and fund of knowledge. {{PRONOUN-2}} score placed within the **\_\_** range on the Nonverbal Composite, suggesting **\_\_** nonverbal cognitive reasoning abilities, ability to solve novel problems, and ability to generate hypotheses and derive solutions.

## Underestimate due to not understanding directions

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall results suggest a personal strength in non-verbal ability; however, due to {{PRONOUN-2}} difficulty understanding task demands and expressing {{PRONOUN-2}} answers, these results likely represent an underestimate of {{PRONOUN-2}} cognitive functioning. As such {{CHILD-NAME}} should be reassessed in the near future, utilizing a comprehensive battery geared towards children with speech and language impairment.

## Underestimate Due to Language Delays

Behavioral observations revealed {{CHILD-NAME}} to be highly cooperative and agreeable; however, {{PRONOUN-2}} severe language delays often interfered with {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to participate in the fixed battery administered as part of the Health Brain Network research project. On the KBIT-2, a brief measure of overall intellectual functioning, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s Full Scale IQ was in the ‘lower extreme range’, with an advantage for non-verbal over verbal skills. However, due to {{PRONOUN-2}} difficulty understanding task demands and expressing {{PRONOUN-2}} answers, these results likely represent an underestimate of {{PRONOUN-2}} cognitive functioning.

## No significant Variability

### Standard

On the WISC-V, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall level of general intellectual function was in the **\_** range, as compared to peers {{PRONOUN-2}} age. Specifically, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated appropriately developed verbal comprehension (i.e., understanding of verbal concepts and vocabulary knowledge) and fluid reasoning (i.e., using logic to solve problems and identifying connections between abstract concepts). {{PRONOUN-2}} visual spatial processing (i.e., evaluating visual details/spatial relationships) was also within normal limits. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance was also within normal limits on cognitive proficiency measures, including working memory (i.e., recalling, manipulating, and sequencing information) and processing speed (i.e., efficiently processing visually presented information).

## Bilingual/influence of culture and language on scores

This is especially notable in the context of {{PRONOUN-2}} status as a non-native English speaker, as vocabulary acquisition is highly dependent on language exposure. Test performance was likely due primarily to the influence of cultural and linguistic factors rather than lack of actual ability.

## Between Index Variability

### Not Valid

On the WISC-V/WAIS-IV, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall level of general intellectual function was extremely variable, with skills ranging from very low to average. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s Full Scale IQ summary score is not valid and instead, a careful examination of the individual indices provides more insight into {{CHILD-NAME}}’s strengths and weaknesses.

### Relative Weakness in EF

#### Standard

On the WISC-V, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s intellectual functioning placed within the **\_** range overall, suggesting **\_\_** abilities as compared to same aged peers. {{CHILD-NAME}} exhibited a personal strength in verbal comprehension (i.e., acquired knowledge and verbal reasoning). {{PRONOUN-2}} nonverbal skills were also in the **\_\_** range including {{PRONOUN-2}} fluid reasoning (i.e., nonverbal reasoning with abstract visual concepts) and visual spatial skills (i.e., evaluating visual details/spatial relationships). Alternatively, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance on measures of executive functioning was comparatively lower, although still within the average range for {{PRONOUN-2}} age. This included measures of {{PRONOUN-2}} working memory (i.e., recalling, manipulating, and sequencing information) and processing speed (i.e., efficiently processing visually presented information).

#### With Attention Difficulties

Alternatively, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated comparatively less well-developed skills on measures of cognitive proficiency (i.e., executive functioning). Specifically, {{PRONOUN-0}} performed in the **\_** range on measures of working memory (i.e., recalling, manipulating, and sequencing information) and processing speed (i.e., efficiently processing visually presented information). {{CHILD-NAME}}’s relative weakness in cognitive proficiency suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} will require extra time in class to demonstrate {{PRONOUN-2}} knowledge. {{PRONOUN-2}} profile of scores is commonly found in children with attention difficulties.

### GAI

On the WISC-V, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall level of general intellectual function was in the **\_** range, as compared to peers {{PRONOUN-2}} age. Of note, there was wide variability between {{CHILD-NAME}}’s scores; {{PRONOUN-2}} general reasoning ability with verbal and nonverbal information (GAI), was comparatively higher than {{PRONOUN-2}} cognitive proficiency scores. The General Ability Index (GAI), combines measures of Verbal Comprehension, Visual-Spatial processing and Fluid Reasoning. This score differs from a Full Scale IQ in that it is not influenced by {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance on working memory and processing speed tasks (i.e. executive functioning). {{CHILD-NAME}}’s GAI standard score placed in the XX range (SS=XX, XX %ile).
{{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated **\_\_** performance across measures of verbal reasoning (i.e. understanding of verbal concepts and vocabulary knowledge), fluid reasoning (i.e. nonverbal reasoning with abstract visual concepts) and visual spatial processing skills (i.e. evaluating visual details/spatial relationships). {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance was significantly lower on cognitive proficiency measures, including working memory (i.e. recalling manipulating, and sequencing information) and processing speed (i.e. efficiently processing visually presented information).

### Interpret w/ Caution

On the WISC-V/WAIS-IV, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall level of general intellectual function was in the **\_\_** range, suggesting **\_\_** developed ability as compared to same age peers. However, there was significant variability between {{PRONOUN-2}} performance in different domains, suggesting {{PRONOUN-2}} Full Scale IQ summary score should be interpreted with caution and an analysis of the individual subtests will yield more information.

## Comparison to Previous IQ Scores

### Consistent

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile of strengths and weaknesses was highly consistent with {{PRONOUN-2}} previous evaluation using the WISC-IV/WISC-V in MONTH YEAR.

### Improved

As compared to a previous evaluation using the WISC-IV/WISC-V, completed by {{PRONOUN-2}} school district in MONTH YEAR, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance improved significantly in INDEX. INDEX remained a weakness for {{CHILD-NAME}}.

### Lower

#### Bx Dysreg

As compared to {{PRONOUN-2}} performance on the WISC-IV/WISC-V in MONTH YEAR, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s scores were slightly lower on the current evaluation, likely due to aforementioned behavioral observations. Nevertheless, {{PRONOUN-2}} profile of strengths and weaknesses remained consistent.

#### WAIS vs WISC

As compared to {{PRONOUN-2}} performance on the WISC-V in January 2016, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s scores were slightly lower in the verbal comprehension domain, likely due to the inclusion of the information subtest, assessing acquisition of general knowledge which is not include in the WISC-V. Alternatively, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance on measures of cognitive proficiency were relatively higher than her previous evaluation.

## Domain Specific Weakness:

### VSI

People who struggle with visual spatial processing may have difficulty in accessing mental visual images or struggle with understanding their orientation within a particular space. They also may have problems reading charts, maps, and other visual material and cannot arrange their desk, backpack, or bedroom visually. They may miss seeing certain visual details and have difficulty copying information that is complex in terms of drawing, including maps or simple homework assignments written on a blackboard.

### FRI

Fluid reasoning can be thought of as the ability to use and engage in various mental operations when faced with a relatively novel task that cannot be performed automatically. It includes the ability to discover the underlying characteristic that governs a problem or set of materials, the ability to start with stated rules, premises, or conditions, and engage in one or more steps to reach a solution to a problem. It also affects the ability to reason inductively and deductively with concepts involving mathematical relations and properties. Deficits in fluid reasoning can impact reading comprehension (i.e., the ability to reach general conclusions from specific information), math reasoning and understanding of mathematical concepts and written expression.

### WMI- connection to reading and math

Working memory is the ability to temporarily store and perform a set of cognitive operations on information that requires divided attention and the management of the limited capacity of short-term memory. A weak working memory can also have an impact on learning and students with working memory constraints may struggle with reading and math. Specifically, working memory is key to linking to information held in long-term semantic memory stores to provide the meaning and pronunciation of words,
holding and sequencing sounds for spelling and also for composing, holding, and connecting ideas in written text. Children with weak working memory make more errors when translating numbers from verbal to written form and often have difficulty retrieving number combinations and facts from long-term memory. As a result, working memory resources are not available for more complex aspects of mathematical processing. Math fluency is disrupted because a slow and unpredictable response time is the outcome of lack of automaticity in retrieval of basic math facts.

## Within Index Variability

### standard

Add in after Index sentence if any significant variability b/w subtests in same index
However, there was significant variability between the \_\_\_\_ Index subtest scores, and this index needs to be carefully reviewed. That is, {{PRONOUN-0}} exhibited describe performance describe subtest ability, but {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated describe performance describe subtest ability.

### FRI: Fluid Reasoning

{{PRONOUN-0}} performed variably on tests of fluid reasoning, with average performance on an abstract pattern reasoning task, but difficulty on a quantitative reasoning task. This pattern of scores implies a relative strength in inductive reasoning compared to quantitative reasoning. It is possible that {{PRONOUN-2}} understanding of part-whole relationships may currently be better developed than {{PRONOUN-2}} mathematical reasoning skills.

### PSI

#### Symbol Search > Coding

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s processing speed, or {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to efficiently process visually presented information, was inconsistent; {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated above average processing speed on a visual scanning task (Symbol Search) but struggled on a speeded task with higher demands on fine motor skills (Coding). This suggests that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s difficulty with fine motor skills interfered with {{PRONOUN-2}} performance in this domain.

#### Coding > Symbol Search

{{PRONOUN-2}} performance suggests that paired associate learning and/or fine-motor speed are relative strengths when compared to visual scanning and discrimination.

### VCI: Verbal Comprehension

#### difficulty with vocabulary

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s verbal skills were variable, with average performance on a conceptual reasoning task, but difficulty on a vocabulary task. Delays in verbal knowledge are often associated with reading difficulty, as vocabulary is typically acquired through reading.

#### difficulty with conceptual reasoning

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s verbal skills were variable, with average performance on a vocabulary task, but difficulty on a conceptual reasoning task. This pattern of performance suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} has a very strong ability to learn new words and define them aloud, but appears to have greater difficulty with verbal tasks that require {{PRONOUN-1}} to use abstract reasoning.

### VSI: Visual Spatial Processing

{{PRONOUN-2}} visual spatial processing (i.e., ability to evaluate visual details/spatial relationships) varied between tasks; {{PRONOUN-0}} performed well on a task that required mental rotation of puzzle pieces but struggled on a block design task which required physical construction of objects under a time limit. This pattern of scores may indicate that {{PRONOUN-2}} visuomotor skills may be a weakness relative to {{PRONOUN-2}} overall visual-perceptual and spatial reasoning ability.

### WMI

#### Better Visual than Auditory WM

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance on tests of working memory (i.e., recalling, manipulating, and sequencing information) was variable, as {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated significantly better ability to remember visual rather than auditory stimuli, suggesting {{PRONOUN-0}} would benefit from multi-modal presentation of information in the classroom.

#### Better Auditory than Visual WM

This pattern of strengths and weaknesses suggests that {{CHILD-NAME}} best employs working memory when information is presented in an auditory versus visual format. Further, {{PRONOUN-0}} performs better when a free recall paradigm is used, rather than a recognition paradigm. {{PRONOUN-0}} may attend to and process information more readily when it is presented in an auditory rather than a visual format.

On the WAIS-IV, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s intellectual functioning as measured by the Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) placed within the **\_** range overall, suggesting **\_** abilities as compared to same aged peers. {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated **\_** perceptual reasoning (i.e., nonverbal reasoning with abstract visual concepts and evaluating spatial relationships) and verbal comprehension (i.e., acquired knowledge and verbal reasoning) with scores placing in the **\_** range for {{PRONOUN-2}} age. {{CHILD-NAME}} also demonstrated **\_** skills on measures of cognitive proficiency (i.e., executive functioning). Specifically, {{PRONOUN-0}} performed in the **\_** range on measures of working memory (i.e., recalling, manipulating, and sequencing information) and processing speed (i.e., efficiently processing visually presented information).

## Working memory and processing speed

Working memory and processing speed abilities perform in conjunction with an individual’s verbal and nonverbal cognitive reasoning abilities and support {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to work in an effective and efficient manner. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s working memory placed within the **\_\_** range, suggesting typical verbal working memory skills. {{PRONOUN-2}} processing speed placed within the **\_\_** range, suggesting **\_\_** speed of mental and cognitive processing.

## ADHD Profile

{{CHILD-NAME}} exhibited a personal and normative strength in perceptual reasoning (i.e. nonverbal reasoning with abstract visual concepts and evaluating spatial relationships), with scores in the very high range. {{PRONOUN-2}} verbal comprehension (i.e. acquired knowledge and verbal reasoning) was also well-developed and advanced, placing within the high range for {{PRONOUN-2}} age. Alternatively, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated comparatively less well-developed skills on measures of cognitive proficiency (i.e. executive functioning). Specifically, {{PRONOUN-0}} performed in the **\_** range on measures of working memory (i.e. recalling, manipulating, and sequencing information) and processing speed (i.e. efficiently processing visually presented information). {{CHILD-NAME}}’s relative weakness in cognitive proficiency suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} will require extra time in class to demonstrate {{PRONOUN-2}} knowledge. {{PRONOUN-2}} profile of scores is commonly found in children with attention difficulties.

## GAI > FSIQ

On the WAIS-IV, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s intellectual functioning as measured by the Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) placed within the **\_** range overall, suggesting **\_** abilities as compared to same aged peers. However, it is important to note that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance between domains was significantly variable, suggesting it is not an accurate representation of {{PRONOUN-2}} ability. Alternatively, the General Ability Index (GAI), which combines measures of Verbal Comprehension and Perceptual Reasoning, provides an estimate of general intelligence without the influence of cognitive proficiency (i.e. working memory and processing speed). {{CHILD-NAME}}’s GAI was significantly higher than the FSIQ (GAI = XX) and placed {{CHILD-NAME}} at the XX percentile.

## Within Index variability

### PRI: Perceptual Reasoning

{{PRONOUN-0}} performed variably on tests of perceptual reasoning, with average performance on an untimed inductive reasoning task (Matrix Reasoning), but difficulty on a visuospatial constructional task (Block Design).

### VCI: Verbal Comprehension

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s verbal skills were variable, with average performance on a conceptual reasoning task (Similarities), but difficulty on a word knowledge task (Vocabulary). Delays in verbal knowledge are often associated with reading difficulty, as vocabulary is typically acquired through reading.

### WMI: Working Memory

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance on tests of Working Memory (i.e. ability to recall, manipulate, and sequence information) was variable, as {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated significantly better ability to remember auditory stimuli than mentally manipulate number operations.

### PSI: Difficulty with Coding

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s processing speed, or {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to efficiently process visually presented information, was inconsistent; {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated above average processing speed on a visual scanning task (Symbol Search) but struggled on a speeded task with higher demands on fine motor skills (Coding). This suggests that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s difficulty with fine motor skills interfered with {{PRONOUN-2}} performance in this domain.

# Grooved Pegboard

## Average

Fine motor coordination was intact bilaterally on a grooved pegboard task, indicating appropriately developed fine motor dexterity.

## Low/variable- no functional difficulty

Fine motor coordination on a grooved pegboard task was intact for {{CHILD-NAME}}’s dominant hand, but was low for {{PRONOUN-2}} non-dominant hand. Considering no functional fine motor concerns were reported, this is not an area warranting further assessment or concern at this time.

## Low-Assistive Tech

Additionally, fine motor coordination on a grooved pegboard task was poor, indicating bilateral hand weakness. Qualitative observations also revealed difficulty with letter formation and handwriting. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}} should continue to receive occupational therapy as per the recommendation of {{PRONOUN-2}} current therapist. An assistive technology evaluation is recommended, in order to allow {{CHILD-NAME}} to express {{PRONOUN-4}} in writing, without {{PRONOUN-2}} fine motor skill difficulty interfering (see below).

## Observed Difficulty with Grip

Fine motor coordination was intact bilaterally on a grooved pegboard task. However, difficulty with handwriting was reported and an immature pencil grip was observed in session. As such, an occupational therapy evaluation and assistive technology evaluation is recommended (see below).

Developmental Coordination Disorder, requires confirmation
{{CHILD-NAME}}’s fine motor coordination on a grooved pegboard task was poor, indicating bilateral hand weakness. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} history of fine motor delays which impact academic and daily life functioning, {{PRONOUN-0}} likely meets criteria for a diagnosis of Developmental Coordination Disorder. The diagnosis is listed as requires conformation due to limited motor testing on the current evaluation. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}} should continue to receive occupational therapy as per the recommendation of {{PRONOUN-2}} current therapist. An assistive technology evaluation is recommended, in order to allow {{CHILD-NAME}} to express {{PRONOUN-4}} in writing, without {{PRONOUN-2}} fine motor skill difficulty interfering (see below).

# ACADEMIC Summaries

## Average Template

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2. {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated appropriately developed reading skills, including sight word recognition, decoding, reading fluency and comprehension. In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated average skills in completing calculations, applied problem solving (e.g., visually presented word problems, measurement, charts/graphs, time, money) and math fluency. On a measure of spelling skills, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed in the average range.

## 5 Year Old/Kindergarten

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4. {{PRONOUN-2}} level of achievement in pre-academic mathematic skills was variable, average skills in applied problem solving (i.e. counting, charts, money etc.), and slightly below average skills in completing calculations. {{CHILD-NAME}} did not display ability to write numbers or letters during the evaluation. Tests of reading were not administered, however, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed variably on tests of phonological processing, skills which are highly related to early reading development. Specifically, {{CHILD-NAME}} struggled on a phonological awareness task in which {{PRONOUN-0}} was required to blend words together. {{PRONOUN-0}} also demonstrated vulnerability in {{PRONOUN-2}} rapid naming skills (i.e., ability to identify symbols and objects quickly). As such, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s early reading development should be monitored closely, and phonologically based interventions should be put in place if {{PRONOUN-0}} is not keeping pace with expectations.

## Gifted

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4, and TOWRE-2. {{PRONOUN-2}} overall performance indicated academic skills well above age expectations and commensurate with {{PRONOUN-2}} extremely high cognitive potential. Specifically, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated math skills in the extremely high range (XX percentile) as compared to same aged peers including {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to complete calculations and applied math problem solving. In reading, {{CHILD-NAME}} also demonstrated extremely advanced skills including basic decoding and fluency, as well as reading comprehension. {{PRONOUN-2}} spelling performance was also extremely high.

## Requires Support, no dx

### Math Support

#### Difficulty with applied problem solving, language delays

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2 and {{PRONOUN-2}} performance was compared to peers {{PRONOUN-2}} age. {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated appropriately developed reading skills, including basic sight word recognition, decoding and comprehension. {{PRONOUN-2}} reading fluency represented an area of strength with scores in the high range for {{PRONOUN-2}} age. In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated average skills in completing calculations, but struggled with applied problem solving. {{PRONOUN-2}} difficulty with applied math is consistent with {{PRONOUN-2}} history of language delays, as often these problems require a high level of oral comprehension. {{CHILD-NAME}} will require support to organize {{PRONOUN-2}} approach and understand what the math questions are asking for.

#### Difficulty with written math problems

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2 and {{PRONOUN-2}} performance was compared to peers {{PRONOUN-2}} age. {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated appropriately developed reading skills, including sight word recognition, decoding, reading fluency and comprehension. In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated average skills in completing calculations and applied problem solving. Per observation however, {{CHILD-NAME}} avoided writing {{PRONOUN-2}} math work on paper and over-relied on mental calculation. Math is reportedly difficult for {{CHILD-NAME}} in school, due to the demands on organization and multi-step operations. {{PRONOUN-0}} performed in the average range on a spelling measure, however {{CHILD-NAME}} reportedly demonstrates difficulty with writing at school. As such {{PRONOUN-0}} requires support in math and domains (see recommendations below).

#### Math Anxiety

In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed in the high average range on a measure of calculations and in the average range on an applied problem-solving test. This was in contrast to reports that {{PRONOUN-0}} struggles with math in school. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s aforementioned relative weakness in nonverbal skills can be associated with math difficulty. Per report, {{CHILD-NAME}} has low self-esteem regarding math and presents with math anxiety that interferes with {{PRONOUN-2}} performance. As such, recommendations are provided below to learn math strategies and coping skills for anxiety.

### Writing Support

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2. As compared to peers {{PRONOUN-2}} age, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated appropriately developed reading skills, including sight word recognition, decoding, reading fluency and comprehension. In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated average skills in both completing calculations and applied problem solving. {{PRONOUN-0}} performed in the average range on a spelling measure, however {{CHILD-NAME}} reportedly demonstrates difficulty with writing at school. Often children with executive functioning weakness struggle with writing, due to the high demands on organization of ideas. {{CHILD-NAME}} requires support in this domain (see recommendations below).

### Reading Support

#### Low Rapid Naming/Fluency, Insufficient Evidence

{{CHILD_NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4. His/Her mathematic skills were measured in the average range on tests of applied problem solving (i.e. counting, charts, money etc.), and completing calculations. In reading, {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrated age appropriate sight-word recognition, decoding and comprehension for his/her age. However, his/her reading fluency, or efficiency, was slightly below expectations. In addition, {{CHILD_NAME}} performed variably on tests of phonological processing, skills which are highly related to early reading development. Although he/she demonstrated appropriately developed phonological awareness and memory, his/her rapid naming skills were well below expectations (i.e. ability to identify symbols and objects quickly). Deficits in rapid naming are correlated with overall processing speed ability and can make gaining meaning from text significantly more difficult; when identifying symbols is effortful and slow, fewer cognitive resources are available for understanding what is read. The current evaluation did not find sufficient evidence of a learning disorder in reading. Nevertheless, considering vulnerability in reading fluency and rapid naming, {{CHILD_NAME}} should continue to receive reading remediation in school in order to increase his/her automaticity. 

### Grade Norms

#### Average math, below average TOWRE

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and compared to peers in {{PRONOUN-2}} grade rather than age (due to {{PRONOUN-2}} repeating a grade). {{PRONOUN-2}} level of achievement in pre-academic mathematic skills was within the average range in applied problem solving (i.e., counting, charts, money etc.) as well as in completing calculations. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reading fluency was measured using the TOWRE-2 and compared to same aged peers (as grade norms were not available). {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance was below expectations in reading sight words and decoding nonsense words quickly, as compared to peers {{PRONOUN-2}} age. It is important to note that {{CHILD-NAME}} has not been exposed to X grade level reading skills, as are typical of children {{PRONOUN-2}} age, and thus these scores may represent an underestimate of {{PRONOUN-2}} potential in reading. {{CHILD-NAME}} performed variably on tests of phonological processing, skills which are highly related to early reading development. Specifically, {{CHILD-NAME}} struggled on phonological awareness tasks and also demonstrated vulnerability in {{PRONOUN-2}} rapid naming skills (i.e., ability to identify symbols and objects quickly). As such, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s early reading development should be monitored closely, and phonologically based interventions should be put in place in order to support {{PRONOUN-2}} reading development in coming years.

#### Difficulty with applied problem solving and reading

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and compared to peers in {{PRONOUN-2}} grade rather than age (due to {{PRONOUN-2}} repeating a grade). {{PRONOUN-2}} level of achievement in mathematical calculations was on par with {{PRONOUN-2}} grade, however {{PRONOUN-0}} struggled on a test of applied problem solving (i.e., counting, charts, money etc.), which included higher demands on language and conceptual understanding. {{PRONOUN-2}} basic reading skills as compared to same grade peers was very low, including {{PRONOUN-2}} sight-word recognition, decoding and fluency. {{PRONOUN-2}} reading comprehension was similarly below expectations.

### Low Academics, Avoidant behavior, R/O learning disorders

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4, and TOWRE-2. In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated delayed skills as compared to same aged peers in math calculation and applied problem-solving. On reading measures, {{CHILD-NAME}} also demonstrated significant delays in sight word recognition, word reading fluency and reading comprehension. Per observation, {{CHILD-NAME}} became extremely agitated and frustrated during academic activities and displayed anxious and avoidant behaviors which interfered with {{PRONOUN-2}} effort and completion of the activities. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} behavioral dysregulation during testing, the current evaluation did not have sufficient evidence to diagnose a learning disorder in reading, writing or mathematics. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} reported history of difficulty with academics it is crucial that {{CHILD-NAME}} receive intensive reading, math and writing support as outlined below, in conjunction with behavioral and emotional supports. As additional interventions are implemented to support {{CHILD-NAME}}’s behavior and engagement in school, close monitoring of {{PRONOUN-2}} academics is recommended in order to rule out diagnoses of specific learning disorders.

### Low IQ

#### With weaknesses in comprehension

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4. In reading, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s basic skills of sight word recognition and decoding were well-developed and within the average range for {{PRONOUN-2}} age. {{PRONOUN-0}} also demonstrated appropriately developed reading fluency for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, with quick and accurate reading. In writing, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated good spelling skills, within normal limits for {{PRONOUN-2}} age. However, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reading comprehension could not be validly assessed, as {{PRONOUN-0}} did not demonstrate ability to comprehend questions and generate novel verbal responses in the current evaluation. Regarding mathematics, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed in the low range on a test which required {{PRONOUN-1}} to complete numerical calculations. {{PRONOUN-0}} was not able to complete applied problem solving due to the complexity of language in the questions. Overall, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reading skills represent a personal area of strength and demonstrate {{PRONOUN-2}} potential for learning. This strength should continue to be fostered and developed, as reading skills will be extremely valuable in {{PRONOUN-2}} education.

#### With general intellectual delay

Considering {{CHILD_NAME}}’s general intellectual delay, he/she does not meet criteria for a specific learning disorder, which otherwise would be given in the absence of intellectual disabilities. Nevertheless, {{CHILD_NAME}} should be making more progress in his/her reading and requires intensive support to address his/her basic reading skills, using an evidence-based and phonologically-based program (as described below).

### Still Needs Support

#### Standard

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2. {{PRONOUN-2}} performance was well below expectations as compared to same aged peers across the domains of reading math and spelling. In reading, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated very low basic reading skills including {{PRONOUN-2}} decoding, sight-word recognition and fluency. Per observation, {{PRONOUN-0}} was able to recognize some sight-words but struggled with phonetic decoding. Additionally, on measures of phonological processing, which are highly predictive of reading performance, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated impairment in phonological awareness, phonological memory and rapid naming skills. Given {{CHILD-NAME}}’s low cognitive functioning, {{PRONOUN-0}} does not meet criteria for a specific learning disorder, which otherwise would be given in the absence of developmental disabilities. Nevertheless, {{CHILD-NAME}} has the ability to make progress in {{PRONOUN-2}} reading skills and {{PRONOUN-0}} requires intensive, evidence-based remediation to improve {{PRONOUN-2}} skills (as described below).

#### Average Performance, Observed/Reported Difficulty

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2. As compared to peers {{PRONOUN-2}} age, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated reading skills that were within normal limits for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, including sight word recognition, decoding, reading fluency and comprehension. Although {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reading performance was largely within the average range on the current battery of tests, testing observations revealed difficulty with phonetic decoding and breaking down words {{PRONOUN-0}} did not recognize by sight. It is important to note that the administered reading assessments are not comprehensive and that observations suggest that {{CHILD-NAME}} continues to require support in reading. As such, continued reading support is recommended so that {{PRONOUN-0}} can keep progressing to the expected level of proficiency for {{PRONOUN-2}} age (see reading recommendations below). {{PRONOUN-2}} performance should be monitored closely, and further comprehensive evaluation can rule out a specific learning disorder. In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated average skills in both completing calculations and applied problem solving. {{PRONOUN-0}} also performed in the average range on a spelling measure.

Notably, per parent reports, {{CHILD-NAME}} struggled significantly to acquire foundational reading skills during the early elementary grades. Furthermore, {{PRONOUN-0}} continues to demonstrate difficulty in writing with reversals and weak spelling. Per {{PARENT-NAME}}, {{CHILD-NAME}} frequently confirms the directionality of {{PRONOUN-2}} numbers and letters with {{PRONOUN-2}} mother when completing homework assignments, and occasionally struggles to remember what particular letters looks like (i.e., lower case f). Individuals rely on both phonological processing (identifying and manipulating sounds-auditory) and orthographic processing (which letters represent which sounds- visual) to read and write accurately and efficiently. Results suggest that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s phonological processing is slightly more developed than {{PRONOUN-2}} orthographic processing, likely due to prior interventions. Individuals with orthographic processing difficulties often exhibit encoding, or spelling, weaknesses due to weaknesses in storing word and letter formations into memory. This can also impact fluency as they struggle to recognize words or chunks of words rapidly and automatically and as a result must decode them repeatedly. As such, encoding and fluency should be a primary focus of intervention efforts.

## SLD-Reading

### Confirmed

#### Phonological issues

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2. In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated average skills in completing calculations and applied math problem solving, however {{PRONOUN-0}} mildly struggled with math fluency, likely associated with {{PRONOUN-2}} slower processing speed. In reading, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated severe delays across foundational and higher order reading skills including sight word identification, decoding, reading fluency and reading comprehension. On measures of phonological processing, skills which are highly predictive of early reading performance, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated a significant deficit in phonological awareness. {{PRONOUN-2}} rapid naming skills, associated with orthographic processing, were intact. Considering that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reading skills are significantly lower than would be expected accounting for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, intelligence and education, {{PRONOUN-0}} meets DSM-5 criteria for a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in reading. As such individualized and specialized reading instruction is required (as described below).

#### Phonological and Orthographic Issues 

{{CHILD_NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4, and TOWRE-2. {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrated delays across foundational reading skills, including poorly developed sight word recognition, phonemic decoding, and spelling. Evaluation of his/her reading fluency revealed severe delays in both sight word and phonemic decoding efficiency. In spite of his/her demonstrated difficulties in basic reading skills, {{CHILD_NAME}} performed exceptionally well on an untimed reading comprehension task, suggesting that he/she likely relies on alternative strategies and his/her strong verbal reasoning ability to gain meaning from text (i.e., using the context of the question and pictures to understand the passage). As {{CHILD_NAME}} progresses through elementary school, these strategies will be less effective, and he/she will require reading support in order to strengthen his/her knowledge of as well as his/her automaticity with phonemic decoding and sight word recognition. It is also important to consider that it was an untimed task. Based on his/her demonstrated fluency weaknesses, it is very likely {{CHILD_NAME}}’s score would be significantly weaker had this been a timed task. {{CHILD_NAME}}’s poor basic skills can make gaining meaning from text significantly more difficult; when decoding is effortful and slow, fewer cognitive resources are available for understanding what is read. Furthermore, as measured by the CTOPP-2, {{CHILD_NAME}}’s phonological processing, a skill predictive of reading and language, was variable. Individuals rely on both phonological processing (identifying and manipulating sounds-auditory) and orthographic processing (which letters represent which sounds- visual) to read accurately and efficiently. Individuals with orthographic processing difficulties often exhibit fluency vulnerabilities as they struggle to recognize words or chunks of words rapidly and automatically and as a result must decode them repeatedly. As such, fluency should be a primary focus of intervention efforts. Considering {{CHILD_NAME}}’s history of reading difficulty despite interventions and significant weaknesses in reading fluency, a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in reading is warranted. He/she requires the immediate implementation of an intervention that effectively addresses his/her areas of need. 

### Initial Dx

#### Grade Norms

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2. As compared to same grade peers, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed within the low range across all reading domains, including measures of basic reading, comprehension and reading fluency (i.e. speed of word recognition). Additionally, on the CTOPP-2, measuring phonological processing, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated weakness in phonological awareness, phonological memory and rapid naming skills. This is consistent with {{PRONOUN-2}} deficient processing speed as measured on the WISC-V. Considering that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reading fluency is significantly lower than would be expected accounting for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, intelligence and education, {{PRONOUN-0}} continues to meet DSM-5 criteria for a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in reading. As such individualized and specialized reading instruction is recommended (as described below). In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed comparatively better, with scores in the low average range for {{PRONOUN-2}} grade. {{CHILD-NAME}} continues to require support in math to make progress with {{PRONOUN-2}} skills.

#### Poor Decoding and Fluency

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2. In reading, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated sight word identification and decoding skills which were in the average range. However, {{CHILD-NAME}} was observed to struggle with the nonsense word decoding and demonstrated an effortful, not automatic decoding style. {{PRONOUN-2}} decoding fluency, or efficiency of reading non-words, was well below expectations. Poor reading fluency can make gaining meaning from text significantly more difficult; when decoding is effortful and slow, fewer cognitive resources are available for understanding what is read. On an untimed reading comprehension task, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed within the average range. {{PRONOUN-0}} was observed to use compensatory strategies to gain meaning from text (i.e. using the context of the question and pictures to understand the passage). As {{CHILD-NAME}} progresses through elementary school, these strategies will be less effective, and {{PRONOUN-0}} will require reading support in order to build up the speed of {{PRONOUN-2}} decoding and sight-word recognition. On measures of phonological processing, skills which are highly predictive of early reading performance, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed in the lower bounds of the average range, but significantly below expectations considering {{PRONOUN-2}} superior verbal comprehension. Considering that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reading fluency is significantly lower than would be expected accounting for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, intelligence and education, {{PRONOUN-0}} meets DSM-5 criteria for a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in reading. As such individualized and specialized reading instruction is recommended (as described below).

In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated above average skills in completing calculations, but had mild difficulty with applied math problem solving, which includes higher demands on abstract reasoning (consistent with {{PRONOUN-2}} weakness in fluid reasoning on the WISC-V).

#### Low Reading and CTOPP

##### Also low in math

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT- 4 and TOWRE-2. In reading, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated very low performance across measures of basic reading, comprehension and reading fluency. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s poor basic skills can make gaining meaning from text significantly more difficult; when decoding is effortful and slow, fewer cognitive resources are available for understanding what is read. Similarly, on measures of phonological processing (CTOPP-2), which are the foundation of reading performance, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated deficits in both phonological awareness and phonological memory. This suggests that {{CHILD-NAME}} requires remediation using a phonologically based approach to address underlying deficits in these processes which are integral to reading. Considering that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reading performance is significantly lower than would be expected accounting for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, intelligence and education, {{PRONOUN-0}} meets DSM-5 criteria for a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in reading. As such it is crucial that individualized and specialized reading instruction be provided (as described below).

In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated comparatively stronger skills, but still demonstrated difficulty as compared to same aged peers. Applied problem solving which includes reading and language comprehension will likely be difficult for {{CHILD-NAME}} as {{PRONOUN-0}} proceeds into higher grades. As such, math will also be an area in which {{CHILD-NAME}} requires support.

##### Higher skills in math

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT- III and TOWRE-2. In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated superior skills in completing calculations and average applied math problem solving. Alternatively, in reading, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated performance well below expectations across measures of basic reading, decoding, comprehension and reading fluency. On measures of phonological processing (CTOPP-2), which are the foundation of reading performance, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated phonological awareness skills which were in the lower bounds of the average range. Although not deficient, {{PRONOUN-2}} skills in this domain are in stark contrast to {{PRONOUN-2}} cognitive ability. {{PRONOUN-2}} spelling skills were also low, consistent with phonological vulnerabilities. Considering that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reading performance is significantly lower than would be expected accounting for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, intelligence and education, {{PRONOUN-0}} meets DSM-5 criteria for a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in reading. As such, it is crucial that individualized and specialized reading instruction be provided (as described below).

#### Reading and math

In reading, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated very low performance across measures of basic reading, comprehension and reading fluency. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s poor basic skills can make gaining meaning from text significantly more difficult; when decoding is effortful and slow, fewer cognitive resources are available for understanding what is read. Similarly, on measures of phonological processing (CTOPP-2), which are the foundation of reading performance, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated a deficit in phonological awareness. This suggests that {{CHILD-NAME}} requires remediation using a phonologically based approach to address underlying deficits in these processes which are integral to reading. Considering that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reading performance is significantly lower than would be expected accounting for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, intelligence and education, {{PRONOUN-0}} meets DSM-5 criteria for a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in reading. In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed well below expectations on tests of applied problem solving and calculations. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s aforementioned deficits in fluid reasoning and visual spatial processing are associated with academic difficulty in math. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} longstanding difficulty in mathematics and significant underperformance as compared to same aged peers, {{CHILD-NAME}} also meets criteria for a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in mathematics. Recommendations are provided below for evidenced based remedial support and accommodations.

#### SLD-R with IDD

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2. {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated severe delays across basic reading skills, including extremely low to low sight word recognition, decoding and reading fluency as compared to same aged peers. {{PRONOUN-2}} reading comprehension also placed in the very low range. Furthermore, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s phonological processing, a skill predictive of reading and language, was very low across measures of phonological memory, phonological awareness and phonological memory. These results suggest that {{CHILD-NAME}} requires intensive phonologically based and evidence-based support to build up {{PRONOUN-2}} fluency and speed of sight word recognition. Considering that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s decoding, reading fluency, phonological processing and comprehension are significantly lower than would be expected accounting for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, intelligence and education, {{PRONOUN-0}} meets DSM-5 criteria for a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in reading. It is important to note that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s delays in reading extend beyond the expected level associated with intellectual delay and are consistent with deficits associated with dyslexia which can be responsive to effective intervention. As such individualized and specialized reading instruction is recommended (as described below). {{CHILD-NAME}} also performed well below expectations on measures of spelling and math. Writing and mathematics were not measured comprehensively on the current evaluation in order to determine diagnosis of a specific learning disorder. Nevertheless, {{CHILD-NAME}} will require continued support to improve {{PRONOUN-2}} math and writing performance (see strategies below).

### Presumptive

#### Standard

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2. In reading, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated sight word identification skills in the lower bounds of the average range. However, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated more difficulty with nonsense word decoding and demonstrated an effortful, not automatic decoding style. {{PRONOUN-2}} reading fluency, or efficiency of reading, was below expectations. Poor reading fluency can make gaining meaning from text significantly more difficult; when decoding is effortful and slow, fewer cognitive resources are available for understanding what is read. On an untimed reading comprehension task, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed within the low average range. Furthermore, on measures of phonological processing (CTOPP-2), which are the foundation of reading performance, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated deficits in both phonological awareness and phonological memory. This suggests that {{CHILD-NAME}} requires remediation using a phonologically based approach to address underlying deficits in these processes which are integral to reading. Considering that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reading performance is significantly lower than would be expected accounting for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, intelligence and education, {{PRONOUN-0}} meets DSM-5 criteria for a presumptive diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in reading. The diagnosis is listed as presumptive as it is common practice to implement and monitor response to a targeted intervention prior to definitively making this diagnosis. As such it is crucial that individualized and specialized reading instruction be provided (as described below).

#### Young child, at risk for SLD-R

To appropriately understand {{CHILD-NAME}}’s current reading skills, it is critical that we conduct an item analysis and consider information provided from teacher and parent narratives, clinical reports, and school observations. Based on that information, we are highly concerned about {{PRONOUN-2}} foundational reading and emerging literacy skills. Specifically, we see that {{CHILD-NAME}} has profound difficulties sounding out words, and {{PRONOUN-0}} has a significantly limited sight word vocabulary. Additionally, {{PRONOUN-0}} exhibits a number of the key features that are hallmark of a child who meets diagnostic criteria for a Specific Learning Disorder, with Impairment in Reading. Notably, {{PRONOUN-0}} has core receptive and expressive language impairments, and {{PRONOUN-0}} struggles with poorly developed rapid naming skills, significantly underdeveloped phonics skills, and marked weaknesses in {{PRONOUN-2}} recognition of letter-sound blends. Despite the standard test results being near or within normal limits and lack of a significant discrepancy in {{PRONOUN-2}} standardized test scores, {{CHILD-NAME}} requires immediate and effective reading interventions. Without the provision of the recommended services, {{PRONOUN-0}} will continue to significantly struggle with appropriately accessing the curriculum, and {{PRONOUN-0}} will be prevented from developing adequate academic skills. Further, without the implementation of appropriate services, {{CHILD-NAME}} will likely meet full diagnostic criteria for a learning disability in reading in the near future.

#### Limited scope of tests at HBN

{{CHILD_NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2. In reading, {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrated sight word identification and decoding skills which were in the average range. However, {{CHILD_NAME}}’s reading fluency was in the low average range and was observed to be effortful and slow. Poor reading fluency can make gaining meaning from text significantly more difficult. On an untimed reading comprehension task, {{CHILD_NAME}} performed within the lower part of the average range. Considering his/her poor fluency, {{CHILD_NAME}} likely employs compensatory strategies to gain meaning from text (i.e. using the context of the question and pictures to understand the passage). As {{CHILD_NAME}} progresses through elementary school, these strategies will be less effective, and he/she will require reading support in order to build up the speed of his/her sight-word recognition, especially for timed- tasks. On measures of phonological processing, skills which are highly predictive of early reading performance, {{CHILD_NAME}} performed within the XX range, with vulnerability in rapid naming and phonological awareness. Considering {{CHILD_NAME}}’s history of reading difficulty despite interventions and weaknesses in reading fluency and comprehension, a presumptive diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in reading is warranted. The diagnosis is listed as presumptive due to the limited scope of tests included in the current evaluation. Continued individualized and specialized reading instruction is recommended (as described below).

### Previous Diagnosis

#### Low across all reading domains, related difficulty with MPS

{{CHILD_NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT- III and TOWRE-2. As compared to same aged peers, {{CHILD_NAME}} performed well below expectations across all reading domains, including measures of basic reading, comprehension and reading fluency (i.e. speed of word recognition). Additionally, on the CTOPP-2, measuring phonological processing, {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrated significant deficits in phonological awareness, phonological memory and rapid naming skills. These phonological skills are integral to reading achievement. Considering that {{CHILD_NAME}}’s reading performance continues to be significantly lower than would be expected accounting for his/her age, intelligence and education, he/she continues to meets DSM-5 criteria for a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in reading. As such individualized and specialized reading instruction is recommended (as described below). In math, {{CHILD_NAME}} performed comparatively better, with expected level skills in completing calculations, and mildly low applied problem-solving skills; It is important to note that {{CHILD_NAME}}’s difficulty with reading likely interfered with his/her performance on math problems in which reading was required. 

#### Sight word recognition and comprehension better than decoding

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2. In reading, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated very advanced reading comprehension skills, as well as above average sight-word recognition. Conversely, {{PRONOUN-2}} phonetic decoding was comparatively lower, although still in the average range for {{PRONOUN-2}} age. This suggests that {{CHILD-NAME}} relies on whole word-reading techniques, rather than phonological decoding. Similarly, on measures of {{PRONOUN-2}} reading fluency (i.e. reading quickly and accurately), {{CHILD-NAME}} struggled more with phonetic fluency rather than sight word fluency. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} strong reading comprehension, {{CHILD-NAME}} seems to have developed compensatory strategies for reading, including using background knowledge and context to gain meaning from text. However, it is important to note that the reading comprehension task was not timed, and {{PRONOUN-0}} will likely need accommodations for timed tasks. {{PRONOUN-2}} spelling performance was in the low average range, another task which relies heavily on phonetic processing. Considering that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reading performance continues to be significantly lower than would be expected accounting for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, intelligence and education, {{PRONOUN-0}} continues to meet DSM-5 criteria for a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in reading. As such continued individualized and specialized reading instruction is recommended (as described below).

### Dyslexia Profile

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile is consistent with the current conceptualization for dyslexia. Per the DSM-5, dyslexia is an “alternative term” used to refer to a pattern of learning difficulties that specifically pertain to accurate or fluent word identification, decoding, and spelling. As such, individualized and specialized reading instruction is necessary.

### Rule-Out SLD-R Diagnosis

#### Poor Reading Fluency, Insufficient Evidence

{{CHILD_NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2. In reading, {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrated sight word identification and decoding skills which were in the lower part of the average range. However, {{CHILD_NAME}}’s reading fluency or efficiency was well below expectations. Poor reading fluency can make gaining meaning from text significantly more difficult. On an untimed reading comprehension task, {{CHILD_NAME}} performed within the lower part of the average range. Considering his/her poor fluency, {{CHILD_NAME}} likely employs compensatory strategies to gain meaning from text (i.e. using the context of the question and pictures to understand the passage). As {{CHILD_NAME}} progresses through elementary school, these strategies will be less effective, and he/she will require reading support in order to build up the speed of his/her sight-word recognition. On measures of phonological processing, skills which are highly predictive of early reading performance, {{CHILD_NAME}} performed largely within the average range, including phonological awareness, phonological memory and rapid naming. At this time, there is not sufficient evidence for a diagnosis. Nevertheless, it is critical that following intervention (as described below), {{CHILD_NAME}}’s reading skills be closely monitored and re-evaluated to rule-out a Specific Learning Disorder, with impairment in reading. 

#### Young age, inconsistent instruction due to pandemic

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4, and TOWRE-2. In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated appropriately developed math calculation, however struggled with more applied problem-solving skills. Recommendations for math problem solving are provided below. On reading measures, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated below expected performance across tests of foundational reading skills (i.e., sight word recognition, decoding and reading fluency) as well as reading comprehension. Furthermore, on measures of phonological processing (CTOPP-2), which are the foundation of reading performance, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated mild weakness in both phonological awareness and rapid naming. These scores suggest {{CHILD-NAME}} is at risk for development of a reading disorder. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} young age and inconsistent instruction due to the pandemic, there is insufficient evidence for a diagnosis at this time. Nevertheless, it is critical that evidence-based interventions be implemented (as described below) and {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reading skills be closely monitored and re-evaluated to a rule-out a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, with Impairment in Reading in the future.

#### Behavioral/developmental/language/situational factors

Based on XXXXX, {{CHILD-NAME}} has difficulties with decoding/sounding out words, and {{PRONOUN-0}} reads in a slow and effortful manner and often guesses words. However, {{CHILD-NAME}} exhibits profound behavioral dysregulation across settings, including during the current evaluation. More often than not, {{PRONOUN-0}} is inattentive, over-active, impulsive, and oppositional. Although these behavioral/developmental/language/situational factors are likely undermining {{CHILD-NAME}}’s ability to acquire the expected academic skills and may account for {{PRONOUN-2}} below expected performance. Thus, it is difficult to determine if {{PRONOUN-2}} difficulties with making adequate academic progress are related to true learning difficulties, issues related to behavioral dysregulation, in particular, oppositionality, a combination of both, and/or another factor. As a result, a rule-out diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, with Impairment in Reading is warranted and{{PRONOUN-0}}should be closely monitored following behavioral intervention.

#### Inconsistent Instruction

{{CHILD_NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4, and TOWRE-2. In math, {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrated appropriately developed math calculation and applied problem-solving skills. On reading measures, {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrated average sight word recognition skills, as well as word reading fluency. Furthermore, he/she performed above average on an untimed reading comprehension task in which he/she was allowed to refer back to the passage. However, {{CHILD_NAME}} struggled to decode nonsense words accurately and fluently. Difficulty with reading nonwords can be indicative of weakness in phonological awareness (sounds). Although {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrated good reading comprehension, he/she was observed to use compensatory strategies which will likely be less effective as he/she proceeds to higher grades and more complex reading. Considering both his/her difficulty with reading decoding and his/her aforementioned mild weakness in phonological awareness, {{CHILD_NAME}} is at risk for development of a reading disorder. It is important to note that due to behavioral difficulties, {{CHILD_NAME}}’s school attendance has been highly inconsistent. As such, insufficient instruction cannot be ruled out as the cause of his/her delays in reading. As additional interventions are implemented to support {{CHILD_NAME}}’s behavior and engagement in school, close monitoring of his/her reading is recommended and he/she should be re-evaluated to a rule-out a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, with Impairment in Reading in the future.

### Initial Dx

315.1 (F81.2) Specific Learning Disorder, with impairment in mathematics

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2. In reading, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated appropriately developed basic sight-word recognition and decoding. {{PRONOUN-2}} spelling performance was also in the average range, another task which relies heavily on phonological processing. {{PRONOUN-2}} reading comprehension skills were close to the average range. {{PRONOUN-2}} reading fluency however, was well below expectations and likely compromised by {{PRONOUN-2}} slow processing speed. This suggests that {{CHILD-NAME}} requires extended time in order to demonstrate {{PRONOUN-2}} knowledge. In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed well below expectations on tests of applied problem solving and calculations. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s aforementioned deficits in fluid reasoning and executive functioning are associated with academic difficulty in math. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} longstanding difficulty in mathematics and significant underperformance as compared to same aged peers, {{CHILD-NAME}} meets criteria for a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in mathematics. Recommendations are provided below for evidenced based remedial support and accommodations.

### R/O SLD-Math

#### Difficulty in school

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2. {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated average reading skills, including sight word recognition, decoding, fluency and comprehension. {{PRONOUN-2}} spelling skills were also within normal limits for {{PRONOUN-2}} age. Although her reading comprehension and writing were within normal limits on the current limited evaluation, these are reported areas of difficulty in school. As such strategies are provided below. In math, however, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed variably. {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated average math fluency but struggled mildly with completing math operations and applied problem solving. This was consistent with {{PRONOUN-2}} reported difficulty with math in school. Considering limited math testing on the current evaluation and no history of intervention, there was insufficient evidence to make a diagnosis of a learning disorder at this time. However, recommendations for math support are outlined below and a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in mathematics, should be ruled out in a future comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation.

#### School report not available

In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed well below expectations considering {{PRONOUN-2}} age and cognitive ability. Information regarding {{CHILD-NAME}}’s math performance in school was not available at the current evaluation and {{PRONOUN-2}} math skills were not a referral concern. A rule-out diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in mathematics, is listed below along with recommendations for academic support in this domain.

### Presumptive

#### Standard

In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed in the low average range on tests of applied problem solving and calculations. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s aforementioned deficits in executive functioning are associated with academic difficulty in math. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} longstanding difficulty in mathematics and significant underperformance as compared to same aged peers, {{CHILD-NAME}} likely meets criteria for a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in mathematics. This diagnosis is listed below as presumptive, due to the limited math tests administered in this evaluation and use of age rather than grade-based norms. Recommendations are provided below for evidenced based remedial support and accommodations in math.

#### Grade norms

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and compared to peers in {{PRONOUN-2}} grade in addition to peers his age due to {{PRONOUN-2}} repeating grades two times. As compared to peers in {{PRONOUN-2}} grade, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated reading skills which ranged from low average to average and were very close to age-level expectations. {{PRONOUN-2}} sight word recognition and decoding placed in the low average range, while {{PRONOUN-2}} reading fluency and comprehension placed in the average range for {{PRONOUN-2}} grade. In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} struggled and demonstrated low scores on tests of applied problem solving and calculations, both for his age and grade. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s aforementioned deficits in perceptual reasoning and executive functioning are associated with academic difficulty in math. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} longstanding difficulty in mathematics and significant underperformance as compared to same grade peers, {{CHILD-NAME}} likely meets criteria for a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in mathematics. This diagnosis is listed below as presumptive, due to the limited math tests administered in this evaluation. Recommendations are provided below for evidenced based remedial support and accommodations in math.

## SLD-Writing

### By History

315.2 (F81.81) Specific Learning Disorder, with impairment in written expression

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4, and TOWRE-2. In reading, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated above average basic skills including {{PRONOUN-2}} decoding, sight-word recognition, spelling and reading fluency. {{PRONOUN-2}} reading comprehension was also above average for {{PRONOUN-2}} age. However, in math, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated more variable skills. {{PRONOUN-2}} applied problem-solving skills were well-developed when presented with word problems, which {{PRONOUN-0}} was generally able to answer using mental calculations. Alternatively, {{CHILD-NAME}} struggled on a math calculation task, in which {{PRONOUN-0}} was asked to perform numerical operations using a pencil and paper. Per observation, {{CHILD-NAME}} was avoidant of completing problems which required effort and gave up easily. {{PRONOUN-0}} also demonstrated low self-esteem in math and frequently engaged in negative self-talk, putting {{PRONOUN-4}} down. {{CHILD-NAME}} requires support to build {{PRONOUN-2}} tolerance for frustration for unpreferred activities and increase {{PRONOUN-2}} academic motivation (see recommendations below).

Although written expression was not comprehensively evaluated on the current evaluation, {{CHILD-NAME}} reportedly demonstrates difficulty with writing at school and displays severe anxiety and avoidance behavior in connection to writing. A diagnosis of Specific learning disorder, With impairment in written expression is listed below, by history, in order to reflect {{CHILD-NAME}}’s previous diagnosis. In addition to aforementioned assistive technology access, {{CHILD-NAME}} requires continued support to improve {{PRONOUN-2}} written organization skills (see recommendations below).

### Rule-out:

Lastly, although written expression was not comprehensively evaluated on the current evaluation, {{CHILD-NAME}} reportedly demonstrates difficulty with writing at school and displayed low spelling on the current evaluation. Further evaluations can rule out a diagnosis of Specific learning disorder, With impairment in written expression. In addition to aforementioned assistive technology access, {{CHILD-NAME}} requires continued support to improve {{PRONOUN-2}} written organization skills (see recommendations below).

### Writing concerns- no dx

#### Standard

Although written expression was not comprehensively evaluated on the current evaluation, {{CHILD-NAME}} reportedly demonstrates difficulty with writing and handwriting at school, specifically with organization of {{PRONOUN-2}} ideas. Often individuals with executive functioning and attentional weaknesses struggle with writing due to the high demands on organizational skills. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}} will benefit from support to improve {{PRONOUN-2}} written organization skills (see recommendations below).

#### Secondary to reading

In writing, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated average essay composition and sentence composition towards the low end of the average range. Alternatively, on a measure of spelling skills, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed in the low range. Spelling skills (e.g., encoding) are highly linked to phonological processing skills and reading. It is important to understand that the development of written expression skills is highly dependent on reading. Given {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance on measures of written expression (e.g., sentence composition and essay composition) were within normal limits and {{PRONOUN-2}} severe deficits in reading, there is insufficient evidence to diagnose a learning disorder in written expression at this time. However, given the history of difficulty in writing in school and {{PRONOUN-2}} mild weakness in sentence composition, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s development of writing skills should be closely monitored and further evaluation should be considered in the future if {{PRONOUN-2}} writing skills do not progress adequately with support for writing and reading.

## SLD-Reading, Writing and Math

### Previous SLD-R diagnosis

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2. {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated variable reading skills, with {{PRONOUN-2}} reading comprehension, word accuracy and decoding falling in the average range, while {{PRONOUN-2}} reading fluency (i.e. ability to read quickly and accurately), was well below expectations for {{PRONOUN-2}} age. Difficulty with reading fluency is often found in individuals with slow processing speed, and slow reading fluency can interfere with comprehension. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}} continues to meet criteria for a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disability, with impairment in reading. In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed below expectations considering {{PRONOUN-2}} age and cognitive ability. {{PRONOUN-2}} performance was consistent with {{PRONOUN-2}} reported difficulty with math in school. As such, {{PRONOUN-0}} also continues to meet criteria for a diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in mathematics. Written expression was not assessed on the current evaluation, however, a Specific Learning Disorder with impairment in written expression is listed below based on {{PRONOUN-2}} previous diagnosis (by history). {{PRONOUN-0}} will continue to require academic support in the domains of reading, writing and math.

On the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s score exceeded the criterion cut-off for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, suggesting intact foundational skills. On WIAT-4 tasks of listening comprehension, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated above average ability to comprehend auditorily presented passages and vocabulary.

## Language Disorder

### By History

On tasks of listening comprehension, {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrated average listening comprehension sills. However, on the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD_NAME}}’s score did not meet the cut off for his/her age, suggesting language delays. Additionally, {{CHILD_NAME}}’s phonological processing on the CTOPP-2, an area highly predictive of reading achievement, was very low as compared to same-aged peers. This profile of results is consistent with reports of language delays from an early age and his/her previous diagnosis of a mixed receptive and expressive language disorder. As such a diagnosis of Language Disorder is listed below by history.

### Rule out

#### Standard

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s language and communication skills were assessed using several measures; On the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s score did not meet the cut off for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, suggesting language delays and need for further evaluation. On WIAT-4 tasks of listening comprehension, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated average ability to receptively understand extended informal passages and vocabulary. Additionally, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s phonological processing, an area highly predictive of reading achievement, was significantly delayed. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} profile of language results a comprehensive speech language evaluation is suggested, in order to rule out a diagnosis of Language Disorder, and further assess {{PRONOUN-2}} language profile in order to make appropriate recommendations for interventions.

#### With deficit in phonological/auditory working memory

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s language and communication skills were assessed on several measures. On measures of listening comprehension (i.e. receptive language) from the WIAT-4, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated appropriately developed receptive vocabulary and comprehension of orally presented passages. Alternatively, on the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s score was below the criterion cut-off, suggesting vulnerability in foundational language skills. Additionally, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s phonological processing, an area highly predictive of reading achievement, was variable; {{PRONOUN-2}} phonological memory was within the low range, in accordance with {{PRONOUN-2}} aforementioned deficit in auditory working memory. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance was within normal limits on measures of rapid naming and phonological awareness. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} profile of language results and history of language delays, a comprehensive speech language evaluation is suggested, in order to further assess {{PRONOUN-2}} language profile in order to make appropriate recommendations for interventions and rule out a diagnosis of a Language Disorder.

### Presumptive

{{CHILD_NAME}}’s language and communication skills were assessed on several measures: On WIAT-4 tasks of listening comprehension, {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrated below average ability to receptively understand orally presented passages and vocabulary. Furthermore, observations during the current evaluation revealed difficulty expressing and formulating language clearly and comprehending instructions. On the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD_NAME}}’s score did not meet the cut off for his/her age, suggesting language delays and need for further evaluation. Examiner observations indicated difficulty with articulation, which occasionally interfered with {{CHILD_NAME}}’s intelligibility. Additionally, {{CHILD_NAME}}’s phonological processing, an area highly predictive of reading achievement, was significantly delayed. Considering his/her profile of language results, as well as his/her reported history of language delays, a DSM-5 diagnosis of Language Disorder is appropriate. Prior to definitively making this diagnosis, it is common practice to complete a comprehensive language evaluation.  From this perspective, the diagnosis at present could be considered presumptive. A comprehensive speech language evaluation is suggested, in order to confirm this diagnosis. The comprehensive speech evaluation can further assess his/her language profile in order to make appropriate recommendations for interventions. 

### Requires Confirmation

#### Standard

{{CHILD_NAME}}’s language and communication skills were assessed using several measures; On the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD_NAME}}’s score did not meet the cut off for his/her age, suggesting language delays and need for further evaluation. On WIAT-4 tasks of listening comprehension, {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrated average ability to receptively understand extended informal passages and vocabulary. This suggests that his/her receptive language is better developed than his/her expressive skills. Additionally, {{CHILD_NAME}}’s phonological processing, an area highly predictive of reading achievement, was significantly delayed. Considering his/her profile of language results a comprehensive speech language evaluation is suggested, in order to confirm a diagnosis of Language Disorder, and further assess his/her language profile in order to make appropriate recommendations for interventions. 

#### With history of language delays

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s language and communication skills were assessed using several measures; On the WIAT-4 tasks of listening comprehension, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated average ability to receptively understand extended informal passages and vocabulary. This suggests that {{PRONOUN-2}} receptive language is better developed than {{PRONOUN-2}} expressive skills. Observations during the current evaluation revealed difficulty expressing thoughts clearly and word retrieval issues. On the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s score did not meet the cut off for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, suggesting language delays and need for further evaluation. Additionally, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s phonological processing, an area highly predictive of reading achievement, was significantly delayed, as discussed above. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} profile of language results, as well as {{PRONOUN-2}} reported history of language delays, a DSM-5 diagnosis of Language Disorder is appropriate. A comprehensive speech language evaluation is suggested, in order to confirm this diagnosis, and further assess {{PRONOUN-2}} language profile in order to make appropriate recommendations for interventions.

#### Recommending Bilingual Evaluation

##### Standard

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s language and communication skills were assessed on several measures; On the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s score did not meet the criterion cut-off, suggesting language delays. On tasks of listening comprehension, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated below average ability to receptively understand extended informal passages and vocabulary. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} profile of language results, as well as long documented history of language delays (even before learning a second language), a DSM-5 diagnosis of Language Disorder is appropriate. A comprehensive speech language evaluation is suggested, with consideration of bilingual and dialectal influence, in order to confirm this diagnosis, further assess {{PRONOUN-2}} language profile and make appropriate recommendations for interventions.

##### With weakness in verbal comprehension on the WISC-V

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s language and communication skills were assessed on several measures; On the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s score did not meet the cut off for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, suggesting language delays and need for further evaluation. On tests of listening comprehension from the WIAT-4, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated appropriately developed receptive understanding of vocabulary, however, {{PRONOUN-0}} struggled with comprehension of orally presented passages. This is consistent with {{PRONOUN-2}} aforementioned weakness in verbal comprehension on the WISC-V. Qualitative observations during the current evaluation also revealed difficulty expressing thoughts clearly and comprehending more advanced language. On measures of phonological processing (CTOPP-2), a set of skills highly related to early reading development and decoding, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated appropriately developed phonological memory and rapid naming. However, {{PRONOUN-0}} displayed mild difficulty with phonological awareness (low average range). Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} profile of language results, as well as {{PRONOUN-2}} reported history of language delays, a DSM-5 diagnosis of Language Disorder is appropriate. A comprehensive speech language evaluation is suggested, in order to confirm this diagnosis, and further assess {{PRONOUN-2}} language profile in order to make appropriate recommendations for interventions. A bilingual speech language evaluation is suggested in order to better differentiate between weaknesses resulting from different exposure to English versus a language disorder.

##### Bilingual - BICS vs CALP

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s language and communication skills were assessed on several measures; On the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s score met the criterion cut-off, suggesting intact foundational skills. On tests of listening comprehension, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated appropriately developed comprehension of orally presented passages. However, {{PRONOUN-0}} struggled in {{PRONOUN-2}} receptive understanding of vocabulary, consistent with {{PRONOUN-2}} aforementioned delay in vocabulary acquisition. It is not unusual for a student to achieve fluency in conversational language (Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills, or BICS) within 1-3 years of learning English. Achieving competency in academic language (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency, or CALP) is a longer and more complex process. This level of language learning is essential for students to succeed in school. It is not unusual for students to take 5-7 years to achieve this type of academic fluency for language.
{{CHILD-NAME}}’s reduced English vocabulary will likely have an impact on {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to learn. As such it is recommended that {{CHILD-NAME}} receive a bilingual speech language evaluation by {{PRONOUN-2}} school district, in order to further assess {{PRONOUN-2}} language differences and better differentiate between weaknesses resulting from less exposure versus a language disorder. Regardless of a diagnosis of a language disorder, {{CHILD-NAME}} should receive therapy with a learning or language specialist, in {{PRONOUN-2}} continued acquisition of language, with specific focus on vocabulary enrichment and building {{PRONOUN-2}} CALP. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s phonological processing on the CTOPP-2 was below expectations across measures of phonological memory, phonological awareness and rapid naming tasks. This finding is consistent with aforementioned auditory processing issues. Phonological processing is highly related to early reading skills, but becomes less important in older children, who begin to utilize whole-word reading techniques and rely less on phonological processes. These results suggest that {{CHILD-NAME}} does have a vulnerability toward reading decoding issues.

### No diagnosis, requires language support

#### Failed CELF, continued speech language support

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s language and communication skills were assessed on several measures; On the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s score did not meet the criterion cut-off, suggesting language delays. On tasks of listening comprehension, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated well below average ability to receptively understand extended informal passages and vocabulary. On the CTOPP-2, {{PRONOUN-2}} phonological processing, skills predictive of reading and language performance, was below expectations across measures of phonological awareness, phonological memory and rapid naming. Considering {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile of language results, as well as long documented history of language delays, continued speech support is recommended as well as accommodations which address language processing (see below). Receptive and expressive language delays make it difficult for {{CHILD-NAME}} to keep up with peers. Classroom activities often involve listening comprehension, verbal reasoning, and oral communication. It is therefore recommended that emphasis is placed on speech and language interventions (see below).

#### Low CTOPP scores

##### No Reading Concern

{{CHILD-NAME}} was also administered tests measuring several aspects of language and phonological processing. On the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s score was well above the criterion cut-off, suggesting intact foundational skills. On WIAT-4 tests of listening comprehension, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated advanced receptive understanding of vocabulary, but less well-developed comprehension of orally presented passages. Per observation, {{CHILD-NAME}} struggled to sustain attention to the passages, interfering with {{PRONOUN-2}} comprehension. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s phonological processing on the CTOPP-2 was below expectations across measures of phonological memory, phonological awareness and rapid naming tasks. However, {{PRONOUN-2}} difficulty in this domain does not appear to interfere with {{PRONOUN-2}} reading skills and {{PRONOUN-2}} phonological processing, as it relates to reading, is not an area requiring remediation at this time.

##### Poor CTOPP but OK Reading Skills

Given that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s basic reading skills seem to be adequately developed—explained in more detail above—{{PRONOUN-2}} lower scores on tasks of phonological processing should not be overly interpreted. However, if {{PRONOUN-0}} begins to struggle with adequately acquiring literacy skills, it will be imperative that {{PRONOUN-0}} complete a more comprehensive evaluation to determine if there are underlying weaknesses in the neurocognitive processes that are integral to the development of literacy skills.

##### Low Rapid naming

###### Standard

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s language and communication skills were assessed on several measures. On the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s score met the criterion cut-off, suggesting intact foundational language skills. {{CHILD-NAME}} also demonstrated appropriately developed skills on WIAT-4 listening comprehension tasks in which {{PRONOUN-0}} was asked to receptively identify vocabulary words and understand oral discourse. {{PRONOUN-2}} phonological processing, a skill predictive of reading, language, and overall achievement, was variable as measured by select subtests of the CTOPP-2; {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated average skills in measures of phonological awareness and memory but struggled in rapid naming tasks. Rapid naming and identification of symbols is an essential underlying process in reading fluency and predictive of overall reading performance. {{PRONOUN-2}} difficulty in rapid naming is consistent with {{PRONOUN-2}} aforementioned processing speed weakness.

##### No Concern

{{CHILD-NAME}} was administered tests measuring several aspects of language and phonological processing. On the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s score was well above the criterion cut-off, suggesting intact foundational skills. On tests of listening comprehension, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated a good receptive understanding of vocabulary as well as comprehension of more extended informal discourse. Phonological processing on the CTOPP-2 was within normal limits on measures of phonological awareness and memory. However, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed in the low average range on rapid naming tasks; per observation {{CHILD-NAME}} became distressed during these tasks due to the timing constraints. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} above average performance on reading decoding tasks, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s phonological awareness is not an area warranting concern at this time.

#### Phono Vulnerabilities

Given that {{CHILD-NAME}} has areas of relative vulnerabilities and mild weaknesses in {{PRONOUN-2}} foundational literacy skills—which are explained in more detail above— {{PRONOUN-2}} lower scores on some of the measures of phonological processing, particularly orthographic processing and fluency, are concerning and likely require targeted and effective intervention. Fluency, or the ability to read with speed and accuracy, is an essential reading skill that is critical to understand text. If children are not fluent in their reading, they are not able to make connections and fully comprehend provided texts. Thus, improvements can be made with regards to {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reading fluency and phonological processing to best support {{PRONOUN-2}} reading abilities as course work becomes more complex and challenging, as to not impede {{PRONOUN-2}} learning.

## Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder

Additionally, consideration for a diagnosis of Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder (SCD) may be appropriate in characterizing {{CHILD-NAME}}’s impairments in social interaction and communication. SCD is defined by primary difficulty with language pragmatics (i.e. the social use of language and communication) as manifested by deficits in understanding and following social rules of verbal and nonverbal communication in various contexts. As the present evaluation is not comprehensive in determining a diagnosis of SCD, a comprehensive speech language evaluation is suggested to elucidate if a diagnosis of SCD is appropriate and guide the most appropriate course of interventions to support social development.

## Lang AND Speech Sound D/O

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s language and communication skills were assessed on several measures: On WIAT-4 tasks of listening comprehension, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated below average ability to receptively understand orally presented passages and vocabulary. Furthermore, observations during the current evaluation revealed difficulty expressing and formulating language clearly and comprehending instructions. On the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s score did not meet the cut off for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, suggesting language delays and need for further evaluation. Examiner observations indicated difficulty with articulation, which occasionally interfered with {{CHILD-NAME}}’s intelligibility. Additionally, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s phonological processing, an area highly predictive of reading achievement, was significantly delayed. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} profile of language results, as well as {{PRONOUN-2}} reported history of language delays, a DSM-5 diagnosis of Language Disorder is appropriate. A comprehensive speech language evaluation is suggested, in order to confirm this diagnosis, as well as a diagnosis of Speech-Sound Disorder. The comprehensive speech evaluation can further assess {{PRONOUN-2}} language profile in order to make appropriate recommendations for interventions.

## Speech Sound Disorder

### Standard

315.39 (F80.0) Speech Sound Disorder
{{CHILD-NAME}}’s language and communication skills were assessed on several measures: On tasks of listening comprehension, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated average ability to receptively understand extended informal passages and vocabulary. On the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s score exceeded the cut off for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, suggesting intact foundational language skills. However, examiner observations indicated difficulty with articulation, which occasionally interfered with {{CHILD-NAME}}’s intelligibility. As such, a DSM-5 diagnosis of Speech-Sound Disorder is warranted. A comprehensive speech language evaluation is suggested to further assess {{PRONOUN-2}} language profile in order to make appropriate recommendations for interventions and confirm this diagnosis.

### Low Overall - IDD

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s language and communication skills were assessed on several measures; On the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s score did not meet the criterion cut-off, suggesting language delays. On tasks of listening comprehension, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated below average ability to receptively understand informal passages and vocabulary. {{PRONOUN-0}} presents with variable speech intelligibility. As such, further assessment of articulation is indicated to rule out a speech-sound impairment. {{PRONOUN-2}} phonological processing, a skill predictive of reading and language, could not be adequately assessed due to difficulty understanding instructions of the tasks. Considering {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile of language results, as well as long documented history of language delays, continued speech support is recommended as well as accommodations which address language processing (see below). Receptive and expressive language delays make it difficult for {{CHILD-NAME}} to keep up with peers. Classroom activities often involve listening comprehension, verbal reasoning, and oral communication. It is therefore recommended that emphasis is placed on speech and language interventions (see below).

## Low Vocabulary due to ESL

### Standard

On the CELF-5 screener of basic language skills, {{CHILD_NAME}}’s score exceeded the criterion cut-off, suggesting intact foundational speech and language skills. On WIAT-4 tests of listening comprehension, {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrated above average comprehension of extended informal discourse, but low average receptive vocabulary knowledge, likely associated with English not being {{CHILD_NAME}}’s dominant language. Phonological processing on the CTOPP-2 was at the expected level for his/her age, including his/her phonological awareness, phonological memory and rapid naming skills. Phonological processing is a skill predictive of reading, and language achievement. It is important to offer {{CHILD_NAME}} support from a learning or language specialist, in his/her continued acquisition of language, with specific focus on vocabulary enrichment.

# Adaptive Fx/Vineland/IDD/Borderline

## IDD

### IDD dx with Vineland

#### Standard

{{CHILD_NAME}}’s overall profile suggests pervasively impaired performance in verbal and nonverbal reasoning, academic functions, executive functions, and fine motor functions. Testing in the present evaluation suggested marked impairments at a level consistent with a diagnosis of an Intellectual Developmental Disorder (IDD). Importantly, the diagnosis of IDD is typically made based on a combination of a score below 70 on a standardized cognitive test and the presence of weaknesses in two or more specific areas of adaptive behavior, referred to Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). These can include communication skills, interpersonal skills, or daily living skills (e.g. getting dressed and using the bathroom independently). Results from the Vineland-3 suggest that {{CHILD_NAME}} has marked ADL impairments in the three measured domains (Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization). As such, based on the current evaluation he/she meets criteria for Intellectual Developmental Disorder, mild/moderate severity. 

#### Mild, severely delayed communication, adequate self-care

{{PARENT-NAME}} completed the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale 3. Results of this assessment indicate {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall level of adaptive functioning falls within moderately low range, indicating that {{PRONOUN-0}} has wide-spread adaptive functioning delays compared to {{PRONOUN-2}} same age peers. We are concerned about {{PRONOUN-2}} severely delayed communication skills, moderately low daily living skills and socialization skills. Overall, the results demonstrate that {{CHILD-NAME}} needs significantly more adult support than {{PRONOUN-2}} peers. Finally, these results are illustrative of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s need for direct instruction in {{PRONOUN-2}} adaptive skills with a view to foster {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to better meet the demands of everyday life. Given these results, a diagnosis of Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder) is warranted. The qualifier of “mild” is given due to {{CHILD-NAME}}’s ability to function age-appropriately in the domain of self-care, although {{PRONOUN-0}} struggles with communication, socialization and academics.

#### Mild, extremely low IQ, adequate language and play skills

{{PARENT-NAME}} completed the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale 3rd Edition, and several questionnaires related to emotional and behavioral function. Per these reports, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall level of adaptive functioning places within moderately low range, indicating that {{PRONOUN-0}} has wide-spread adaptive delays compared to {{PRONOUN-2}} same age peers. Of note, there was some variability within {{PRONOUN-2}} skills, as {{PRONOUN-0}} reportedly demonstrates adequate receptive language, coping and play skills, but struggles as compared to same aged peers with daily living skills, expressive and written communication and aspects of interpersonal relationships. Considering these adaptive delays in combination with aforementioned extremely low scores on a standardized intelligence test, a diagnosis of Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder) is warranted. The qualifier of “mild” is given due to select domains of adequate functioning. Overall, the results demonstrate that {{CHILD-NAME}} needs significantly more adult support than {{PRONOUN-2}} peers. {{CHILD-NAME}} will need direct instruction in {{PRONOUN-2}} adaptive skills, with a view to foster {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to better meet the demands of everyday life.

### IDD Requires confirmation Pending Vineland

319 (F70) Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder), Mild (requires confirmation)
319 (F71) Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder), Moderate (requires confirmation)

Overall, testing results suggested marked cognitive impairments consistent with a diagnosis of Mild Intellectual Developmental Disorder (IDD), pending further evaluation. Typically, this diagnosis is based on a combination of a score below 70 on a standardized cognitive test and the presence of weaknesses in two or more specific areas of adaptive behavior, referred to Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). A standardized tool for testing (e.g., the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales) can be used to determine {{CHILD-NAME}}’s level of functioning in these domains.

### IDD R/O Pending Vineland:

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance across measures of cognitive, academic and neurocognitive functioning was delayed. Due to the fixed nature of the current battery, severe language delays and behavioral regulation difficulty, many of the standardized tests administered on this evaluation were invalid and represent an underestimate of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s ability. {{CHILD-NAME}} should be continually reassessed as {{PRONOUN-2}} language develops, in order to obtain a more accurate picture of {{PRONOUN-2}} strengths and weaknesses. The current evaluation also did not comprehensively assess {{PRONOUN-2}} adaptive skills in the domains of communication, social functioning and daily living skills. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} previously low scores on measures of adaptive functioning, in conjunction with intellectual delays on the current abbreviated testing, further evaluation is warranted in order to comprehensively assess {{CHILD-NAME}}’s speech and language skills as well as adaptive functioning and rule out a diagnosis of Intellectual Disability.

### Previous Dx Global Developmental Delay

{{CHILD-NAME}} was previously diagnosed with ‘Global Developmental Delay’ at age X; {{PRONOUN-2}} performance on the current evaluation continues to be consistent with a diagnosis of Intellectual Developmental Disability. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}} continues to need significantly more adult support than {{PRONOUN-2}} peers. {{CHILD-NAME}} will need direct instruction in {{PRONOUN-2}} adaptive skills, with a view to foster {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to better meet the demands of everyday life.

### Vineland administered; Further Evaluation Needed

#### with depression and absence of a valid cognitive assessment

{{PARENT_NAME}} completed the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale 3. As per his/her report, {{CHILD_NAME}}’s overall level of adaptive functioning falls within the moderately low range, indicating that he/she has wide-spread adaptive functioning delays compared to his/her same age peers. The results demonstrate that {{CHILD_NAME}} needs significantly more adult support than his/her peers, as well as direct instruction in his/her adaptive skills to foster his/her ability to better meet the demands of everyday life. A diagnosis of Intellectual Developmental Disorder is not warranted considering the absence of a valid comprehensive assessment of {{CHILD_NAME}}’s cognitive ability as well as withdrawal related to depression, which made his/her true ability difficult to ascertain. As such, more comprehensive cognitive testing is required following treatment of depression.

#### With IQ > 70

Regarding adaptive functioning, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s parent endorsed overall low adaptive functioning, with wide spread delays as compared to same aged peers. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s communication skills were moderately low, while {{PRONOUN-2}} daily living and socialization skills were in the low range. These results demonstrate that {{CHILD-NAME}} needs significantly more adult support than {{PRONOUN-2}} peers, as well as direct instruction in {{PRONOUN-2}} adaptive skills to foster {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to better meet the demands of everyday life. Considering these impairments in {{PRONOUN-2}} adaptive skills as well as {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance on the abbreviated cognitive testing, {{CHILD-NAME}} is at high risk for a diagnosis of Intellectual Disability. However, as noted previously, the present evaluation consisted of abbreviated IQ testing and a previous evaluation found {{CHILD-NAME}}’s IQ to be above the standard score of ‘70’ cut-off. As such further, more comprehensive testing is recommended to more effectively rule out this diagnosis.

### Low Cognitive fx, no SLD

Given {{CHILD-NAME}}’s low cognitive functioning, {{PRONOUN-0}} does not meet criteria for a specific learning disorder which otherwise would be given in the absence of intellectual disabilities. Nevertheless, {{CHILD-NAME}} has the ability to make more progress in {{PRONOUN-2}} reading skills and {{PRONOUN-0}} requires intensive, evidence-based remediation to improve {{PRONOUN-2}} skills (as described below). Additionally, {{CHILD-NAME}} does not appear to be learning or making progress in {{PRONOUN-2}} current setting, considering scores of ‘0’ in all of {{PRONOUN-2}} subjects. This suggests that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s current placement is not meeting {{PRONOUN-2}} educational needs and {{PRONOUN-0}} requires a placement which is more specialized to {{PRONOUN-2}} developmental level.

As per {{CHILD-NAME}}’s academic scores, it appears {{PRONOUN-0}} is significantly struggling with making adequate academic progress. Given {{PRONOUN-2}} low cognitive functioning, {{PRONOUN-0}} does not meet criteria for a specific learning disorder; however, it is likely that in a classroom setting with additional distractions, {{PRONOUN-0}} struggles substantially with comprehending the curriculum, particularly instruction that is heavily language-based. It is highly recommended that {{PRONOUN-0}} receive continued accommodations (outlined further below) so that {{PRONOUN-0}} can appropriately access the curriculum.

### Adaptive delays with Autism, No IDD

As per parent report, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall level of adaptive functioning places within the low range, indicating that {{PRONOUN-0}} has wide-spread adaptive functioning delays compared to {{PRONOUN-2}} same age peers. The results demonstrate that {{CHILD-NAME}} needs significantly more adult support than {{PRONOUN-2}} peers, as well as direct instruction in {{PRONOUN-2}} adaptive skills to foster {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to better meet the demands of everyday life. A diagnosis of Intellectual Developmental Disorder is not warranted considering {{CHILD-NAME}}’s intact cognitive ability. Therapeutic services to improve social skills, improve adaptability and develop emotional regulation skills are recommended, including applying for OPWDD services.

### IDD by hx (Prev Vineland)

319 (F70) Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder), Mild (by history)

Overall, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance on cognitive and academic tasks is consistent with previous evaluations showing underdeveloped skills across domains. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s scores on these measures are consistent with a diagnosis of Mild Intellectual Disability, and they emphasize {{PRONOUN-2}} need for intensive academic supports and services.

### Previous Dx

#### Standard, mild

{{PARENT_NAME}} completed the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale 3 (Survey Interview Form), in order to assess {{CHILD_NAME}}’s adaptive functioning. As per his/her report, {{CHILD_NAME}}’s overall level of adaptive functioning falls within moderately _____ range, indicating that he/she has wide-spread adaptive delays compared to his/her same age peers. Of note, there was some variability within his/her skills, as he/she reportedly demonstrates adequate socializations skills, but struggles as compared to same aged peers with daily living skills and communication. Considering these adaptive delays in combination with aforementioned low scores on a standardized intelligence test, a diagnosis of Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder) continues to be warranted. The qualifier of “mild” is given due to select domains of adequate functioning. Overall, the results demonstrate that {{CHILD_NAME}} needs significantly more adult support than his/her peers. {{CHILD_NAME}} will need direct instruction in his/her adaptive skills, with a view to foster his/her ability to better meet the demands of everyday life.

## Borderline Intellectual Functioning

### WISC affected by language deficits

V62.89/R41.83 Borderline Intellectual Functioning

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall level of general intellectual function was in the borderline-impaired range. The abbreviated testing conducted as part of the current evaluation suggested marked impairments at a level that warrants a diagnosis of Borderline Intellectual Functioning. It is important to note that {{CHILD-NAME}} does not meet criteria for an Intellectual Developmental Disorder (IDD) at this time. This diagnosis is typically made based on a combination of a score below 70 on a standardized cognitive test and the presence of weaknesses in two or more specific areas of adaptive behavior, referred to as Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). These can include communication skills, interpersonal skills, or daily living skills (e.g., getting dressed and using the bathroom independently). The present evaluation only contained cognitive testing and did not include formal assessment of ADL’s; for this, a standardized tool for testing (e.g., the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale 3) is required. Furthermore, as noted above, given {{CHILD-NAME}}’s history of fundamental core language deficits, as well as the heavy language demands of the WISC-V/WAIS-IV, it may not be the most appropriate measure to evaluate {{CHILD-NAME}}'s cognitive potential. Nonetheless, results may be a true representation of {{PRONOUN-2}} cognitive functioning when working on tasks and in settings with heavy language-based demands, such as a classroom.

### Standard

Due to the impact that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s cognitive functioning is having on {{PRONOUN-2}} academic functioning, a diagnosis of Borderline Intellectual Functioning has been given. Of note, given that {{PRONOUN-2}} cognitive abilities exceed diagnostic criteria, a diagnosis of Intellectual Developmental Disorder (IDD) would be inappropriate at this time. Typically, a diagnosis of IDD is based on a combination of a score below 70 on a standardized cognitive test and the presence of weaknesses in two or more specific areas of adaptive behavior, referred to Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). More thorough testing should be considered in the coming years to provide a clearer assessment of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s cognitive profile.

### Average Vineland, Low IQ no dx of IDD

{{PARENT-NAME}} completed the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale 3. Results of this assessment indicate {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall level of adaptive functioning falls within expected limits. This included measures of {{PRONOUN-2}} communication, daily living and socialization skills.

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall level of general intellectual function placed in the borderline-impaired range. Considering {{CHILD-NAME}}’s history of fundamental core language deficits and the heavy language demands of the WISC-V, it is not the most appropriate measure to evaluate {{CHILD-NAME}}'s cognitive potential and is likely an underestimate of {{PRONOUN-2}} abilities. It is important to note that despite low IQ on the current evaluation, {{CHILD-NAME}} does not meet criteria for an Intellectual Developmental Disorder (IDD), considering aforementioned intact adaptive functioning. A diagnosis of IDD is typically made based on a combination of a score below 70 on a standardized cognitive test and the presence of weaknesses in two or more specific areas of adaptive behavior, referred to as Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Nevertheless, these results indicate that {{CHILD-NAME}} requires intensive support in academics and a specialized school setting that incorporates language support throughout {{PRONOUN-2}} day (as described below).

# Integrated Paragraph Summaries

## Above Avg, Low Self-Esteem Interfering w/ Academics

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} possesses advanced intellectual functioning as compared to same aged peers, with strengths in verbal and nonverbal reasoning skills, as well as working memory. {{PRONOUN-2}} academic skills were generally well-developed and commensurate with reports that {{PRONOUN-2}} school performance is on grade level for {{PRONOUN-2}} age. The current evaluation did not find evidence of a learning disorder. However, it is important to note that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s low self-efficacy regarding {{PRONOUN-2}} reading skills and anxiety (as described below) can interfere with {{PRONOUN-2}} academic achievement. Specifically, when {{CHILD-NAME}} is nervous or in a negative mood, {{PRONOUN-0}} is more likely to struggle with concentration, organization and completing {{PRONOUN-2}} work. As such, intervention with {{CHILD-NAME}} should aim to improve {{PRONOUN-2}} self-efficacy in academics and provide support for utilizing executive functioning skills (described in recommendations below).

## Academic Vulnerabilities but no SLD

Notably, the current evaluation is limited in the scope of academic tests administered and although there was not sufficient evidence to warrant diagnosis of a specific learning disability based on current results, it is important that {{CHILD-NAME}} continue to receive academic support in school.

## Bright Kid w/ Some Vulnerabilities

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall profile suggests average to above average cognitive abilities and academic achievement. {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated moderate difficulties and relative weaknesses with controlled attention, processing speed, and working memory. There is no concern for a specific learning disorder at this time. However, the above weaknesses can negatively impact academic functioning. It will be important to monitor {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance across subjects to determine if any difficulties emerge in the future.

## Avg/ Struggle with Exec Functioning in Real World

### Ability to sustain attention

Regarding executive functioning, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance on formal tests revealed largely intact or better ability to sustain attention and efficiently process information. However, {{CHILD-NAME}} reportedly struggles to implement these skills in the real-world environment, where there are many more distractions and demands on {{PRONOUN-2}} executive skills. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}} requires additional support, accommodations and strategies (as described below) to help improve {{PRONOUN-2}} executive skills and execute tasks efficiently.

### Processing speed and working memory

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} has above average intellectual ability as compared to peers {{PRONOUN-2}} age. It is important to note that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s above average performance on cognitive proficiency tasks (i.e., processing speed and working memory) was attained in optimum conditions (i.e., Structured one-to one testing environment free of distractions). {{CHILD-NAME}} reportedly struggles to execute these skills in a real-world classroom environment where there are higher demands on {{PRONOUN-2}} executive functioning and attention. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}} will benefit from accommodations and strategies (as described below) to help improve {{PRONOUN-2}} executive skills.

### Difficulty with math, emotional regulation

Regarding executive functioning, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance on formal tests revealed intact or better ability to efficiently process information, including {{PRONOUN-2}} working memory and processing speed. However, {{CHILD-NAME}} has longstanding difficulty utilizing these skills consistently, especially on tasks which are anxiety provoking or frustrating for {{PRONOUN-1}} (i.e. math). Individuals who have difficulty regulating their emotions and tolerating frustration often struggle to demonstrate their knowledge in school, where they have difficulty utilizing executive skills of organization, planning and initiating work.

## Behavior Problems, Irritability

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} has the cognitive potential to succeed academically, if provided with proper support for {{PRONOUN-2}} executive functioning deficits and behavior. However, due to difficulty regulating {{PRONOUN-2}} behavior associated with {{PRONOUN-2}} mood and irritability, {{CHILD-NAME}} will continue to need more support than can be provided in a general education environment. Emotional dysregulation is associated with poor executive functioning skills. Children who have difficulty regulating their emotions and tolerating frustration often struggle to stay motivated at school. It is important that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s parents and teachers recognize that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s poor performance in school is not a result of laziness or oppositionality, rather {{PRONOUN-0}} requires support to build coping skills. {{CHILD-NAME}} will require a supportive and structured placement to address {{PRONOUN-2}} emotional and behavioral needs. Additional accommodations and strategies (as described below) will also be required for {{CHILD-NAME}} to make appropriate progress at school and improve {{PRONOUN-2}} self-efficacy.

## Borderline Intellectual Fxn

### Standard

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}} presents with an extremely variable profile, with areas of strength and weakness. {{PRONOUN-2}} personal strength in working memory and organization skills can be very useful in helping {{CHILD-NAME}} overcome areas of weakness and be successful in school. {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated marked impairment in {{PRONOUN-2}} nonverbal skills and processing speed. Due to the impact that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s cognitive functioning has on {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to work independently and learn, a diagnosis of Borderline Intellectual Functioning is appropriate. Academically, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrates strong reading skills, above expectations considering areas of cognitive weakness. Alternatively, {{CHILD-NAME}} struggles with math concepts. Children with non-verbal weaknesses often struggle in math and have difficulty with organization, problem-solving and abstract reasoning. Nonverbal weaknesses can also be related to weaknesses in understanding subtler aspects of language and understanding of abstract ideas and use of context. See recommendations below for visual spatial accommodations and strategies that can be implemented within the classroom for children with deficits in the non-verbal domain. {{CHILD-NAME}} requires continued placement in a supportive and structured classroom environment, as well as strategies to further develop {{PRONOUN-2}} executive skills.

### Borderline IF/SLD-R- post high-school

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} possesses borderline intellectual functioning as compared to same aged peers. However, it is important to note that there was considerable variability within {{PRONOUN-2}} profile.{{PRONOUN-0}}demonstrated relative strengths in processing speed and verbal comprehension, and a significant personal and normative weakness in perceptual reasoning (i.e., non verbal skills). Due to the impact that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s cognitive functioning has on {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to work independently and learn, a diagnosis of Borderline Intellectual Functioning is appropriate. Academically, {{CHILD-NAME}} requires intensive support to build {{PRONOUN-2}} reading skills. Phonological and orthographic interventions can be challenging for adolescents and adults to adhere to, due to the interventions typically being geared toward kids who are younger. Nevertheless, it is crucial that {{CHILD-NAME}} improve {{PRONOUN-2}} basic reading skills to meet the everyday demands of independent living. Recommendations are provided below for vocational resources and supports for {{CHILD-NAME}}.

## Personal weakness in EF, reading, going to college

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} possesses advanced intellectual functioning as compared to same aged peers, with strengths in verbal and nonverbal reasoning skills. However, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated a personal weakness in {{PRONOUN-2}} executive functions (i.e. processing speed and working memory). Furthermore, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated vulnerability in {{PRONOUN-2}} basic reading skills, which are unexpected in the context of {{PRONOUN-2}} advanced intelligence. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}} will require support and accommodations as {{PRONOUN-0}} advances to post-secondary education. It is also important to note that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s low self-efficacy regarding {{PRONOUN-2}} reading skills and anxiety (as described below) can interfere with {{PRONOUN-2}} academic achievement. Specifically, when {{CHILD-NAME}} is nervous or in a negative mood, {{PRONOUN-0}} is more likely to struggle with concentration, organization and completing {{PRONOUN-2}} work. As such, intervention with {{CHILD-NAME}} should aim to improve {{PRONOUN-2}} self-efficacy in academics and provide support for utilizing executive functioning skills (described in recommendations below).

## Classroom Placements

### Low EF

#### Small class

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} possesses overall average intellectual functioning, with appropriately developed visual and verbal reasoning skills. However, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated deficits in {{PRONOUN-2}} executive functions (i.e. processing speed and working memory), which make it difficult for {{PRONOUN-1}} to complete {{PRONOUN-2}} work and perform up to {{PRONOUN-2}} intellectual capability in school. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}} will require full-time placement in a classroom that is small, structured and has support to allow {{PRONOUN-1}} extended time to demonstrate {{PRONOUN-2}} knowledge. {{PRONOUN-2}} teachers should be experienced with children who have specialized learning needs, including individualized development of executive skills as well as intensive reading remediation. Academic intervention with {{CHILD-NAME}} should also focus on building self-esteem in academics and helping {{CHILD-NAME}} learn coping skills for dealing with frustration.

#### ICT

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} possesses overall average intellectual functioning, with appropriately developed visual and verbal reasoning skills. However, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated deficits in {{PRONOUN-2}} executive functions (i.e., processing speed and working memory), which make it difficult for {{PRONOUN-1}} to complete {{PRONOUN-2}} work and perform up to {{PRONOUN-2}} intellectual capability in school. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}} will require a more structured classroom that has specialized support for executive functioning. {{PRONOUN-2}} teachers should be experienced with children who have specialized learning needs, including individualized development of executive functioning skills. Academic intervention with {{CHILD-NAME}} should also focus on building self-esteem in academics and helping {{CHILD-NAME}} learn coping skills for dealing with frustration.

### Specialized Setting, Emotional Support

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-2}} non-verbal reasoning ability is considerably better developed than {{PRONOUN-2}} verbal skills. Weak verbal skills place {{CHILD-NAME}} at risk for reading comprehension problems and may make it difficult for {{PRONOUN-1}} to keep up with peers in the classroom. Classroom activities often involve listening comprehension, verbal reasoning, and oral communication. It is therefore recommended that emphasis is placed on speech and language interventions (see below). Furthermore, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated weakness in executive functioning skills (i.e. auditory working memory, attention cognitive flexibility), which also makes it difficult for {{PRONOUN-1}} to complete tasks as quickly as {{PRONOUN-2}} peers. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} learning profile, {{CHILD-NAME}} requires a specialized school setting with support for reading, speech and language skills integrated throughout {{PRONOUN-2}} day, as well as therapeutic support to address ongoing difficulty with emotional regulation.

### Therapeutic Placement

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} possesses above average general intellectual ability, including {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to reason with verbal and abstract information. {{PRONOUN-2}} strengths in verbal and fluid reasoning should be fostered and encouraged. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s academic skills were advanced for {{PRONOUN-2}} age and commensurate with {{PRONOUN-2}} intelligence. Alternatively, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s visual spatial processing represented an area of relative weakness. Regarding executive functioning, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance on formal tests revealed generally intact or better ability to efficiently process information, including {{PRONOUN-2}} working memory and processing speed. However, {{CHILD-NAME}} has longstanding difficulty utilizing these skills consistently. Teacher reports indicate significant oppositional and avoidant behavior patterns in school which interfere with {{PRONOUN-2}} learning. Individuals who have difficulty regulating their emotions and tolerating frustration often struggle to stay motivated at school. It is thus recommended that in addition to psychotherapeutic interventions, {{CHILD-NAME}} requires a school placement which can provide support for {{PRONOUN-2}} difficulty regulating {{PRONOUN-2}} emotions and behavior (as detailed below).

## Emotional Dysregulation

### Intellectually gifted, anxiety and frustration

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} is an intellectually gifted young man/woman with many areas of cognitive strength. However, {{CHILD-NAME}} struggles to demonstrate {{PRONOUN-2}} knowledge on tests and classwork, due to severe anxiety and low tolerance for frustration. Emotional dysregulation is often associated with poor executive functioning skills; adolescents who have difficulty regulating their emotions often struggle with utilizing executive skills of organization, planning and initiating work. {{CHILD-NAME}} will require a supportive and structured school placement to address {{PRONOUN-2}} emotional and behavioral needs. Intervention with {{CHILD-NAME}} should focus on coping skills for tolerating frustration, increasing academic motivation and engagement and improving executive skills. Accommodations and strategies are described below.

### Weaknesses in executive functioning and processing speed, severe anxiety

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} possesses overall average intellectual functioning, with strengths in nonverbal reasoning skills and working memory. {{PRONOUN-2}} academic skills are generally well-developed considering {{PRONOUN-2}} age and intelligence. However, {{PRONOUN-0}} displayed neurocognitive weaknesses in executive functioning and processing speed which impact {{PRONOUN-2}} academic performance in school and make it difficult for {{PRONOUN-1}} to complete {{PRONOUN-2}} work and learn without support. It is important to note that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s severe anxiety (as described below) interferes with these executive functions and can cause {{PRONOUN-1}} to have difficulty with concentration, organization and completing {{PRONOUN-2}} work. Additionally, parental report indicates that {{CHILD-NAME}} has formed a strong avoidant behavioral pattern in which being non-responsive in school is leading to not having to complete {{PRONOUN-2}} work. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}} will require a small, structured and emotionally supportive setting, where {{PRONOUN-0}} will be given support to decrease avoidance behavior and demonstrate {{PRONOUN-2}} knowledge.

### Strong intellectual abilities, avoidant, requires academic stimulation and behavioral interventions

Several factors appear to make school particularly difficult for {{CHILD-NAME}}. First, {{PRONOUN-2}} strong intellectual capabilities suggest that {{PRONOUN-0}} is not adequately stimulated by the instruction and work associated with a highly restrictive self-contained classroom. Also, {{PRONOUN-2}} poor behavioral and emotional regulation skills prevent {{PRONOUN-1}} from engaging in teacher-directed work. Additionally, {{CHILD-NAME}} has formed a strong avoidant behavioral pattern, in which acting out and exhibiting outbursts results in not having to complete {{PRONOUN-2}} work. It is thus recommended that in addition to psychotherapeutic interventions, {{CHILD-NAME}} requires a school placement which can both provide support for {{PRONOUN-2}} difficulty regulating {{PRONOUN-2}} emotions and behavior as well as academic instruction commensurate with {{PRONOUN-2}} intellectual ability.

## Gifted

### Exceptional nonverbal abilities, weakness in executive functioning

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} has exceptional cognitive abilities in the nonverbal domain which should be fostered. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile aligns with that of a “gifted learner,” and {{PRONOUN-0}} will require learning opportunities that are commensurate with {{PRONOUN-2}} intellectual potential. Simultaneously, {{CHILD-NAME}} presents with a personal weakness in executive functioning. The discrepancy between {{PRONOUN-2}} general intellect and {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to complete work efficiently is likely a source of frustration and anxiety for {{CHILD-NAME}} and others who work with {{PRONOUN-1}}. {{CHILD-NAME}} reportedly struggles to demonstrate {{PRONOUN-2}} knowledge on tests and complete {{PRONOUN-2}} classwork. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s difficulty sustaining attention and weakness in executive functioning impede on {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to succeed in a general education classroom setting. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}} continues to require a specialized setting, accommodations and support geared toward {{PRONOUN-2}} academic and executive functioning vulnerabilities.

### Struggles to implement skills in real-world environment

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} is learning academic material at a level commensurate with {{PRONOUN-2}} intelligence and that {{PRONOUN-0}} has exceptional cognitive abilities. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile aligns with that of a “gifted learner,” and {{PRONOUN-0}} will continue to benefit from being provided with learning opportunities that are commensurate with {{PRONOUN-2}} intellectual potential. Regarding executive functioning, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance on formal tests revealed superior ability to efficiently process information. However, {{CHILD-NAME}} reportedly struggles to implement these skills in the real-world environment, where there are many more distractions and demands on {{PRONOUN-2}} executive skills. As such, {{PRONOUN-0}} will require support in school to stay focused and organize {{PRONOUN-2}} tasks (see below). Academic intervention with {{CHILD-NAME}} should also focus on helping {{PRONOUN-1}} learn coping skills for dealing with frustration, so {{PRONOUN-0}} can continue to learn at a level commensurate with {{PRONOUN-2}} potential and tolerate non-preferred activities.

### Personal Weakness w/ Processing Speed

#### Processing speed within normal limits

{{CHILD_NAME}}’s overall profile suggests that he/she has exceptional cognitive abilities and he/she is learning academic material at a level commensurate with his/her intelligence. His/Her profile aligns with that of a “gifted learner,” and he/she requires learning opportunities that are commensurate with his/her intellectual potential. However, {{CHILD_NAME}} demonstrates a personal weakness in processing speed. Although his/her processing speed was within normal limits for his/her age, the significant difference between his/her processing speed and general intellectual functioning can be a source of frustration and anxiety for {{CHILD_NAME}}. {{CHILD_NAME}} is reportedly resistant to activities which require mental effort, and often claims that activities are boring. As such, he/she will require both accommodations for extra time, as well as coping skills for tolerating frustration, so he/she can continue to learn at a level commensurate with his/her potential and tolerate non-preferred activities.

## Hearing Loss

It is important to note that hearing loss of any degree can affect psychoeducational development adversely; even minimal hearing loss places children at risk for behavior and learning difficulties. Children who are not hearing well may not respond to speech or noises consistently and may appear inattentive. As such, it is critical that {{CHILD-NAME}} continue to receive modifications and accommodations that optimize {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to attend and learn in the classroom.

## Language Disorder

### English Language Learner

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} has cognitive areas of strengths and weakness and thus requires specialized supports in order to be successful in school. Weak phonological processing skills place {{CHILD-NAME}} at risk for difficulty learning to read. As such specialized reading interventions are suggested below. Additionally, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s deficits in executive functioning will make it difficult for {{PRONOUN-2}} to keep up with peers in the classroom. As such executive functioning recommendations are provided below. Lastly and most importantly, {{CHILD-NAME}} continues to present with severe language delays in addition to being an English Language Learner (ELL), which make it difficult for {{PRONOUN-1}} to express herself clearly and receptively understand instructions. It is therefore recommended that emphasis is placed on speech and language interventions (see below). With these supports in place {{CHILD-NAME}} should be able to make appropriate progress in {{PRONOUN-2}} academic skills.

### Invalid IQ due to language weakness, good nonverbal

In sum, during current testing, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall level of general intellectual function was not appropriately assessed with the WISC-V, given {{CHILD-NAME}}’s history of fundamental core language deficits and the heavy language demands of the WISC-V. Thus the results should be interpreted with caution, but may be an accurate representation of {{PRONOUN-2}} cognitive functioning when working on tasks and in settings with heavy language-based demands, such as a classroom. Notably, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated appropriately developed non verbal skills with a marked personal strength in Fluid Reasoning. Furthermore, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated deficits in {{PRONOUN-2}} executive functions (i.e. processing speed and working memory), which make it difficult for {{PRONOUN-1}} to complete {{PRONOUN-2}} work and perform up to {{PRONOUN-2}} intellectual capability in school. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}} will require full-time placement in a classroom that is structured and has support to allow {{PRONOUN-1}} extended time to demonstrate {{PRONOUN-2}} knowledge. {{PRONOUN-2}} teachers should be experienced with children who have specialized learning needs, including individualized development of executive skills as well as intensive speech and language remediation. Recommendations are provided below for appropriate support.

### SLD-R and small specialized setting

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall profile suggests appropriately developed intelligence, with {{PRONOUN-2}} verbal reasoning ability considerably better developed than {{PRONOUN-2}} non- verbal skills. Furthermore, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated weakness in executive functioning skills (i.e., processing sped), which also makes it difficult for {{PRONOUN-1}} to complete tasks as quickly as {{PRONOUN-2}} peers. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} learning profile, {{CHILD-NAME}} requires a specialized school setting with support for reading and executive functioning integrated throughout {{PRONOUN-2}} day.

### Lang Deficits, Borderline IQ, and Impairing Bxes

In sum, during current testing, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall level of general intellectual function fell in the borderline-impaired range. However, as noted above, given {{CHILD-NAME}}’s history of fundamental core language deficits, observed hyperactive/impulsive behaviors during testing, and the heavy language demands of the WISC-V/WAIS-IV, it may not be the most appropriate measure to evaluate {{CHILD-NAME}}'s cognitive potential and is likely an underestimate of {{PRONOUN-2}} abilities. While results should be interpreted with caution, these results may be an accurate representation of {{PRONOUN-2}} cognitive functioning when working on tasks and in settings with heavy language-based demands, such as a classroom. Further, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s mental health symptoms are likely negatively impacting {{PRONOUN-2}} cognitive and academic performance. Immediate intervention is recommended to target these symptoms. Following an appropriate course of treatment, comprehensive reevaluation will be imperative.

### Lang D/O, Avg IQ (Dual Lang) and Rec Further Testing

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall level of general intellectual function was variable with an advantage for non-verbal over verbal skills. As noted above, given {{CHILD-NAME}}’s longstanding history of speech-language delays and exposure to dual-language settings, these scores need to be carefully considered due to the heavy language demands of the assessment tools utilized in the current evaluation. Nonetheless, these results are likely a realistic depiction of {{PRONOUN-2}} daily functioning in academic and non-academic settings with heavy language demands. Additionally, {{PRONOUN-2}} profile suggests difficulties in executive functioning (i.e., weakness in working memory on the WISC-V/WAIS-IV; weaknesses on attention and executive function tasks on the NIH toolbox). The above cognitive disadvantages can negatively impact a child’s/an adolescent’s academic functioning. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance in school should continue to be closely monitored. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s current level of academic achievement was generally commensurate in the domains of basic reading, phonetic decoding, reading comprehension, and spelling given {{PRONOUN-2}} level of general intellectual functioning. However, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance on mathematics tasks represents an area of significant and consistent need for {{PRONOUN-1}} at the time of testing. Given the limited nature of the mathematics tasks administered as part of this assessment, additional testing is recommended at this time for the purposes of diagnostic clarity and intervention planning.

## NVLD Profile/Nonverbal Weakness

### Standard

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} has extremely well-developed verbal skills, however {{PRONOUN-2}} weakness in executive functioning skills (i.e. processing speed) can make it difficult for {{CHILD-NAME}} to complete tasks as quickly as {{PRONOUN-2}} peers. Academically, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reading and math skills are well above expectations for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, however {{CHILD-NAME}} is struggling to demonstrate these skills up to {{PRONOUN-2}} potential at school. {{CHILD-NAME}} will continue to require modifications and accommodations (listed below) which can help {{PRONOUN-1}} manage {{PRONOUN-2}} school workload and everyday responsibilities. Of note, is that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile appears mildly consistent with that of a child with a nonverbal learning disorder (NVLD) with associated executive functioning weaknesses. In general, children with this disorder tend to be stronger in the verbal domain and weaker in areas of visual and tactile perception and novel material. They also tend to have trouble integrating and interpreting incoming information, as they tend to be more focused on details. As a result of their difficulty integrating and processing nonverbal information, they often have trouble with social interactions, which are loaded with non-verbal cues. One area in which children and adolescents with NVLDs tend to have particular difficulty is in their capacity to deal with novelty, including unfamiliar situations and material. In other words, new material and new situations might present a significant challenge for {{CHILD-NAME}} until {{PRONOUN-0}} has had an opportunity to become familiar with the nature of the task or develop new routines. Recommendations and resources associated with improving {{PRONOUN-2}} executive functioning are provided below.

### Gifted

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} is learning academic material at a level commensurate with {{PRONOUN-2}} intelligence and that {{PRONOUN-0}} has exceptional cognitive abilities. {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated a strong advantage for verbal comprehension rather than nonverbal processing. Children with non-verbal weaknesses may struggle with problem-solving and visual math concepts. Nonverbal weaknesses can also be related to weaknesses in understanding subtler aspects of language and understanding of abstract ideas and use of context. Overall, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile aligns with that of a “gifted learner,” and {{PRONOUN-0}} requires learning opportunities that are commensurate with {{PRONOUN-2}} intellectual potential as suggested below.

### With frustration and anxiety

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} is learning academic material at a level commensurate with {{PRONOUN-2}} intelligence and that {{PRONOUN-0}} has exceptional cognitive abilities. {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated a significant personal and normative strength in verbal comprehension, while {{PRONOUN-2}} visual spatial processing was a relative weakness. Nonverbal weaknesses can be related to weaknesses in understanding subtler aspects of language and nonverbal cues in social interactions. Additionally, on formal tests of executive functioning, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated mild relative vulnerability in {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to sustain attention and utilize executive skills. Although {{PRONOUN-2}} executive functioning was within normal limits for {{PRONOUN-2}} age, the significant difference between these skills and general intellectual functioning can be a source of frustration and anxiety for {{CHILD-NAME}}. Written expression is particularly dependent on executive skills and is reportedly difficult for {{CHILD-NAME}}. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}} will benefit from additional structure in {{PRONOUN-2}} home and school environment, as well as strategies to help {{PRONOUN-2}} with writing and executive skills (see below). Overall, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile aligns with that of a ‘gifted learner,’ and {{PRONOUN-0}} requires learning opportunities that are commensurate with {{PRONOUN-2}} intellectual potential as suggested below.

## Low EF/Math/Writing

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} possesses overall average intellectual functioning, with above average visual and verbal reasoning skills. However, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated vulnerability in {{PRONOUN-2}} executive functions (i.e. processing speed and working memory), which make it difficult for {{CHILD-NAME}} to complete {{PRONOUN-2}} work and perform up to {{PRONOUN-2}} intellectual capability in school. Mathematics and written expression are particularly dependent on executive skills and are difficult for {{CHILD-NAME}}. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}} will require a structured classroom environment with support to allow {{PRONOUN-1}} extended time to demonstrate {{PRONOUN-2}} knowledge as well as individualized development of executive skills.

## Low IQ, Anxiety, Language

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} has significant areas of cognitive weakness and thus requires specialized supports in order to be successful in school. Weakness in nonverbal ability is often associated with difficulty in math and {{CHILD-NAME}} will require specialized support in this domain. Additionally, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s deficits in executive functioning will make it difficult for {{PRONOUN-1}} to keep up with peers in the classroom. As such executive functioning recommendations are provided below. Lastly, {{CHILD-NAME}} continues to present with severe language delays, which make it difficult for {{PRONOUN-1}} to express {{PRONOUN-4}} clearly. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s language delays are highly tied in to {{PRONOUN-2}} socially and performance-related anxiety. Deficits in {{PRONOUN-2}} language skills contribute to lower self-confidence, while in turn, anxiety makes {{PRONOUN-1}} less likely to express {{PRONOUN-4}} and practice {{PRONOUN-2}} language, creating a bad cycle. It is therefore recommended that emphasis is placed on speech and language interventions to improve {{PRONOUN-2}} skills (see below) in addition to coping skills to manage {{PRONOUN-2}} anxiety. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} learning profile, {{CHILD-NAME}} requires a specialized classroom with support for speech and language skills integrated throughout {{PRONOUN-2}} day, as well as availability of therapeutic support. With these supports in place {{CHILD-NAME}} should be able to make appropriate progress in {{PRONOUN-2}} academic skills.

## Performance Better than School - Language Impacting Academics

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated appropriately developed cognitive skills, within the average range, demonstrating good ability to reason with verbal and nonverbal information. However, {{PRONOUN-2}} executive functioning skills were variable with inconsistent scores on measures of processing speed and attention tasks. Difficulty with executive skills of managing and organizing information can often make learning in a general classroom environment difficult, and {{CHILD-NAME}} will thus require accommodations and modifications (as listed below) to support {{PRONOUN-2}} attention. Academically, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated skills ranging from low average to average, better than {{PRONOUN-2}} reported low grades in school. Weakness was noted in non-word decoding skills, suggesting that {{CHILD-NAME}} will benefit from reading intervention in school which incorporates evidence-based phonological skills. Following evidence-based intervention, future evaluations should rule out a Specific Learning Disorder in reading. Additionally, qualitative difficulty was observed in tasks requiring language comprehension (reading comprehension and math problem solving). Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} history of speech language delays and services, it is likely that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s difficulty with language comprehension and expression interferes with {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to demonstrate knowledge and understand instruction in a general education classroom. As such, it is imperative that {{CHILD-NAME}} receive appropriate academic support and language instruction which is appropriate for {{PRONOUN-2}} comprehension level (see language-related recommendations below).

## Self-Esteem

Academic intervention with {{CHILD-NAME}} should also focus on building self-esteem in academics and helping {{CHILD-NAME}} learn coping skills for dealing with frustration (see emotional regulation strategies below).

## Twice Exceptional

### Severe behavioral dysregulation

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} is learning academic material at a level commensurate with {{PRONOUN-2}} intelligence and that {{PRONOUN-0}} has exceptional cognitive abilities. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile aligns with that of a “gifted learner,” and {{PRONOUN-0}} requires learning opportunities that are commensurate with {{PRONOUN-2}} intellectual potential. However, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrates severe behavioral dysregulation, which impedes {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to succeed in a general education classroom setting. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}} requires a class placement geared towards ‘twice-exceptional’ learners which can both enrich {{PRONOUN-2}} strengths and provide support for {{PRONOUN-2}} behavior.

### ADHD, SLD-R and behavioral dysregulation

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} has exceptional cognitive abilities in the nonverbal domain which should be fostered. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile aligns with that of a “gifted learner,” and {{PRONOUN-0}} will require learning opportunities that are commensurate with {{PRONOUN-2}} intellectual potential. However, {{CHILD-NAME}} also exhibits behavioral dysregulation associated with ADHD and a reading disability. These weaknesses impede on {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to succeed in a general education classroom setting. As such, {{CHILD-NAME}} requires support geared towards ‘twice-exceptional’ learners which can both enrich {{PRONOUN-2}} strengths and provide support for {{PRONOUN-2}} behavior and reading. Academic intervention with {{CHILD-NAME}} should also focus on building self-esteem in academics and helping {{CHILD-NAME}} learn coping skills for dealing with frustration.

## Verbal Weakness

#### Standard

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-2}} non-verbal reasoning ability is considerably better developed than {{PRONOUN-2}} verbal skills. Weak verbal skills place {{CHILD-NAME}} at risk for reading comprehension problems and may make it difficult for {{PRONOUN-1}} to keep up with peers in the classroom. Classroom activities often involve listening comprehension, verbal reasoning, and oral communication. It is therefore recommended that emphasis is placed on speech and language interventions (see below). Furthermore, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated weakness in executive functioning skills (i.e. processing speed), which also makes it difficult for {{PRONOUN-1}} to complete tasks as quickly as {{PRONOUN-2}} peers. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} learning profile, {{CHILD-NAME}} continues to require a specialized school setting with support for speech and language skills integrated throughout {{PRONOUN-2}} day, as well as therapeutic support to address ongoing difficulty with emotional regulation.

#### Hearing loss

In sum, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall profile suggests that {{PRONOUN-2}} non-verbal reasoning ability is considerably better developed than {{PRONOUN-2}} verbal skills. This suggests that {{CHILD-NAME}} will benefit from visual learning strategies and visual stimuli in the classroom. Furthermore, {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated weakness in executive functioning skills (i.e. processing speed), which can make it difficult for {{CHILD-NAME}} to complete tasks as quickly as {{PRONOUN-2}} peers. It is important to note that hearing loss of any degree can affect psychoeducational development adversely; even minimal hearing loss places children at risk for behavior and learning difficulties. Children who are not hearing well may not respond to speech or noises consistently and may appear to be inattentive. As such, it is critical that {{CHILD-NAME}} continue to receive modifications and accommodations which optimize {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to attend and learn in the classroom.

## Yeshiva Curriculum

In sum, preliminary IQ testing via KBIT assessment indicates that {{CHILD-NAME}} is an intelligent child with appropriately developed verbal and nonverbal skills. Academically, {{CHILD-NAME}} displays appropriately developed math conceptual skills; However, {{PRONOUN-2}} pre-academic skills in writing and reading could not be assessed using the current evaluation, as {{CHILD-NAME}} is not exposed to these elements in {{PRONOUN-2}} curriculum (he attends a Yeshiva program which introduces these skills later on). On tests of executive functioning, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated vulnerability in {{PRONOUN-2}} processing speed, or ability to complete visual tasks quickly and accurately. This suggests that {{PRONOUN-0}} will benefit from extra time in school to complete assignments. Furthermore, a high degree of impulsivity and difficulty with behavior regulation was reported and observed in session. Children who have difficulty regulating themselves require a highly structured learning environment, with support for reinforcing positive behavior and promoting adaptive responses to frustration.

# BX OBS/MSE

## ADHD

{{CHILD-NAME}} was evaluated over the course of three sessions. For each of the appointments, {{PRONOUN-0}} was adequately groomed and dressed in weather-appropriate clothing. Throughout the evaluation, {{PRONOUN-0}} made consistent eye-contact and spontaneous conversation. When prompted with informal conversational questions, {{CHILD-NAME}} provided socially appropriate and topic-related responses. {{PRONOUN-2}} voice was typical in pace and intonation, but louder in volume. However, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s articulation was poor, often requiring repetition for clarification by the examiner, and {{PRONOUN-2}} speech was replete of grammatical errors. During the evaluation, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s mood was euthymic, and {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated a range of appropriate affect, as indicated by {{PRONOUN-2}} brief smiles and laughter. Overall, the testing environment was comfortable, free from overt distractions, and conducted in an examinee: examiner ratio of 1:1 at all times.

Despite the intensively structured and individualized setting, {{CHILD-NAME}} struggled with regulating {{PRONOUN-2}} attention, and {{PRONOUN-0}} often demonstrated hyperactive or impulsive behaviors. For example, {{PRONOUN-0}} was observed to frequently fidget in {{PRONOUN-2}} seat, move {{PRONOUN-2}} arms to and from the table, switch positions in {{PRONOUN-2}} seat, rest {{PRONOUN-2}} head on and off the table, inappropriately manipulate provided materials (i.e., stimulus book), and stand from {{PRONOUN-2}} seat. {{PRONOUN-0}} would also interrupt the examiner as directions or items were being provided to {{PRONOUN-1}} or initiate conversations about non-relevant topics (e.g., school). At times, {{CHILD-NAME}} would begin to respond to items before being prompted to do so. To support {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to complete the evaluation tasks, {{CHILD-NAME}} was provided with firm limits, tangible incentives (i.e., stickers), and redirection to stay focused on the task-at-hand. {{PRONOUN-0}} required prompts and reminders to use {{PRONOUN-2}} finger to keep {{PRONOUN-2}} place when reading as well as repetition of items. With the provision of this supplemental behavioral support, {{CHILD-NAME}} completed all of the evaluation tasks that were presented to {{PRONOUN-1}}. Despite these challenges, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated behaviors that suggested that {{PRONOUN-0}} worked in an effortful manner. For example, when {{PRONOUN-0}} felt that {{PRONOUN-0}} had provided an incorrect response, {{PRONOUN-0}} reconsidered the information provided to {{PRONOUN-1}} and gave a revised answer. During math problems, {{PRONOUN-0}} often counted on {{PRONOUN-2}} fingers or drew diagrams to solve problems. Given {{PRONOUN-2}} longstanding difficulties with regulating {{PRONOUN-2}} behavior across settings, the results of the evaluation are considered to be a realistic depiction of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s functioning, particularly when {{PRONOUN-0}} is working in an individualized setting that provides intensive structure and supplemental behavioral support.

## Dysthymic mood, Anxiety

Testing behavioral observations revealed dysthymic mood and limited affective expression. {{CHILD-NAME}} appeared withdrawn and was reluctant to give verbal responses. {{PRONOUN-0}} did respond verbally when required, in a low, but easily audible voice. {{PRONOUN-2}} verbal output was limited to one-word utterances and sentence fragments, and {{PRONOUN-0}} opted for nonverbal communication whenever possible. Considering {{PRONOUN-2}} apparent anxiety and limited verbal expression, {{PRONOUN-2}} performance on language tasks likely represents an underestimate of {{PRONOUN-2}} intelligence and should be interpreted with caution.

## Learning Problems (R+M)

Notably, {{CHILD-NAME}} struggled on several tasks that measured {{PRONOUN-2}} reading skills. Sight word recognition, phonemic decoding, and spelling were areas of particular difficulty for {{CHILD-NAME}}. {{PRONOUN-0}} was observed to make frequent letter reversal errors (e.g., substituting “b” for “d” or “p”, substituting “d” for “p” or “b”) and frequently left out letters in {{PRONOUN-2}} spelling (e.g., “kac” for “cake”, “tol” for “tall”, “gam” for “game”). {{CHILD-NAME}} also incorrectly sounded out other sight words (e.g., saying “on” for “no”, “me” for “he”, “off” for “of”) and incorrectly recognized nonwords for real words (e.g., “six” for “rix”, “sleep” for “seb”, “zap” for “zad”, “peep” for “dreep”, “bat” for “baf”, “bin” for “din”, “up” for “om”). {{CHILD-NAME}} appeared most avoidant of a task that required {{PRONOUN-1}} to read grade-appropriate passages and provide verbal responses to questions (i.e., Reading Comprehension). Upon being presented with a short story, {{PRONOUN-0}} would quickly claim {{PRONOUN-0}} read the text when in fact {{PRONOUN-0}} had not. On occasion, {{PRONOUN-0}} asked the evaluator to read to {{PRONOUN-1}}, who instead, encouraged {{CHILD-NAME}} to use {{PRONOUN-2}} finger to hold {{PRONOUN-2}} place as {{PRONOUN-0}} read each word to {{PRONOUN-1}}self or out loud. Upon doing so, it was observed that {{CHILD-NAME}} was experiencing significant difficulties with pronouncing sight word and novel words, which appeared to interfere with {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to comprehend the context of the passages. In addition to significant reading difficulties, {{CHILD-NAME}} was also noted to struggle with math. Consistently across all math tasks, {{CHILD-NAME}} frequently identified a subtraction sign (‒) with an addition sign (+) and, subsequently, approached problems using the incorrect operation. {{CHILD-NAME}} also consistently misidentified numbers (e.g., identifying “9” for “6”, identifying “20” for “12”).

## Low Fxn (IDD, ASD)

{{CHILD-NAME}} was evaluated over the course of three sessions. For each of the appointments, {{PRONOUN-0}} was adequately groomed and neatly dressed in weather-appropriate clothing. conversation. When prompted with informal conversational questions, {{CHILD-NAME}} Throughout the evaluation, {{PRONOUN-0}} made poorly modulated eye-contact and excessively spontaneous provided few socially appropriate and topic-related responses. For example, when being asked a question about school, {{CHILD-NAME}} refused to answer. {{PRONOUN-2}} voice was typical in pace. However, {{PRONOUN-2}} volume was loud and {{PRONOUN-2}} voice was atypical in prosody. {{CHILD-NAME}} was also observed to engage in scripting on at least one occasion, repeating the phrase, “trigrams 64 palms”, at least 3 times in a row. {{PRONOUN-0}} noted this was a line from one of {{PRONOUN-2}} favorite television shows about ninjas, which {{PRONOUN-0}} frequently talked about at irrelevant times. When speaking about this seemingly restricted interest, {{CHILD-NAME}} would often talk in monologues and provide extraneous details. Further, {{CHILD-NAME}} used an underdeveloped conversational vocabulary, and {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated weaknesses in {{PRONOUN-2}} command of informal oral language. Secondary to these issues, when standardization permitted, task instructions were repeated and/or explained using simpler language. In regard to {{PRONOUN-2}} affect, which was often flat, {{CHILD-NAME}} was observed to largely grin on occasion, which seemed incongruent to the context. Overall, the testing environment was comfortable, free from overt distractions, and conducted in an examinee: examiner ratio of 1:1 at all times.

Despite the intensively structured and individualized setting, {{CHILD-NAME}} significantly struggled with regulating {{PRONOUN-2}} attention, and {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated a number of hyperactive or impulsive behaviors. For example, {{PRONOUN-0}} frequently interrupted the examiner as directions were being read, provided responses before an entire item was read, moved around in {{PRONOUN-2}} seat, climbed in and out of {{PRONOUN-2}} seat, swung {{PRONOUN-2}} feet under {{PRONOUN-2}} chair, and inappropriately manipulated testing materials (e.g., turned pages before being told to do so, turned spiral bounding of book). Throughout testing, {{CHILD-NAME}} often verbalized that {{PRONOUN-0}} forgot, could not remember, or was not listening to the item being read to {{PRONOUN-1}}. When tasks permitted, {{PRONOUN-0}} was provided with frequent repetitions of directions and items.

Further, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated significant behavioral difficulties with transitioning and rigidity. For example, when the examiner demonstrated two visual scanning tasks, {{CHILD-NAME}} refused to complete the sample and remaining items until the examiner erased the demonstration items. {{PRONOUN-0}} would become disgruntled and stated that {{PRONOUN-0}} does not like when others “do things” before {{PRONOUN-1}}. During writing tasks, {{CHILD-NAME}} became visibly distressed and upset when any of {{PRONOUN-2}} symbols were not exactly the same as the provided icons. Consistently, {{PRONOUN-0}} would perseverate on an incorrect item, repetitively draw over {{PRONOUN-2}} response, and refused to move onto the next item, thus negatively impacting {{PRONOUN-2}} completion time on timed tasks. When providing answers to multiple choice items, {{CHILD-NAME}} would seemingly perseverate on a response (i.e., choice 3) and repetitively give that answer to subsequent items. When provided with pegs to place in pre-selected rows of a board, {{CHILD-NAME}} became visibly distressed and upset when informed to stop by the examiner. {{CHILD-NAME}} verbalized that {{PRONOUN-0}} “need[ed]” to finish placing all pegs in the entire board. Each time, the examiner made note of the correct completion time, and permitted {{CHILD-NAME}} to continue placing pegs, which allowed {{PRONOUN-1}} to transition to the next activity with some ease.

Of note, {{CHILD-NAME}} was also observed to have motor difficulties and engage in possibly sensory behaviors. For example, {{CHILD-NAME}} often pointed with all 5 fingers or {{PRONOUN-2}} elbow, requiring the examiner to ask {{CHILD-NAME}} for verbal clarification of selected responses. {{PRONOUN-0}} appeared to loosely grip {{PRONOUN-2}} pencil with all of {{PRONOUN-2}} fingers when writing. When completing items, {{CHILD-NAME}} sometimes chewed on {{PRONOUN-2}} shirt collar and often rubbed the sides of {{PRONOUN-2}} face with {{PRONOUN-2}} hands. Further, on at least two occasions when {{PRONOUN-0}} was asked to define words, {{CHILD-NAME}} briefly rocked {{PRONOUN-2}} torso from front to back for the duration of the task. {{PRONOUN-0}} was also observed to engage in throat-clearing vocalizations on at least two occasions at the start of a testing session. On a motor task, {{CHILD-NAME}} repetitively moved metal pegs over the metal board to elicit a sound and repetitively pressed the palm of {{PRONOUN-2}} hand over the stationary pegs in the board.

In response to these difficulties, {{CHILD-NAME}} exhibited low internal motivation, irritability, weakly developed frustration tolerance, and poorly developed coping skills. Of note, {{PRONOUN-0}} exhibited these and other similar difficulties with significantly more frequency, in higher severity, and for substantially longer durations of time than what is typical of an examinee {{PRONOUN-2}} age. For example, {{CHILD-NAME}} frequently found tasks to be challenging or unpleasant. {{PRONOUN-0}} would then become easily disengaged and unwilling to continue. When frustrated by a particular item and/or {{PRONOUN-0}} perceived a task or item to be challenging, {{CHILD-NAME}} quickly said, “I don’t know” or refused to answer. {{PRONOUN-0}} often whimpered and frequently expressed {{PRONOUN-2}} dislike over completing any task presented to {{PRONOUN-1}}. {{CHILD-NAME}} appeared to be more resistant to less-preferred tasks (i.e., verbal activities), as evidenced by {{PRONOUN-2}} significant reluctance and non-compliance to do what was asked of {{PRONOUN-1}}. {{CHILD-NAME}} also engaged in a number of self-injurious behaviors. {{PRONOUN-0}} would lightly hit {{PRONOUN-2}} head with {{PRONOUN-2}} open palm or closed fist. When demonstrating these patterns of behavior and to support {{PRONOUN-2}} ability to complete the evaluation tasks, {{CHILD-NAME}} was provided with frequent firm limits, redirection, a visual schedule, multiple countdowns, social praise, and tangible incentives (i.e., earning stickers) to continue with {{PRONOUN-2}} work. With the provision of this supplemental behavioral support, {{CHILD-NAME}} completed all of the tasks that were presented to {{PRONOUN-1}}. Secondary to the previously described and other difficulties and with the implementation of the previously described supports, the administration took a significantly longer duration of time compared to what is typical for an examinee {{CHILD-NAME}}’s age. Despite these difficulties, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated behaviors that suggested that {{PRONOUN-0}} worked in an effortful manner. For example, as {{PRONOUN-0}} worked on items, {{CHILD-NAME}} often talked {{PRONOUN-1}}self through the problem. Additionally, when {{PRONOUN-0}} felt that {{PRONOUN-0}} had provided an incorrect response at times, {{PRONOUN-0}} reconsidered the information provided to {{PRONOUN-1}} and gave a revised answer. Thus, the results of the evaluation are considered to be a valid depiction of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s functioning, particularly when {{PRONOUN-0}} is working in an individualized setting that provided intensive structure and supplemental behavioral support.

# Remote/COVID Templates

## Remote Testing Templates

### MSE and Behavior Obs

{{CHILD-NAME}} presented as a cooperative, friendly, mature and hard-working boy/girl/young man/woman. {{PRONOUN-0}} appeared {{PRONOUN-2}} stated age and was casually dressed with appropriate grooming and hygiene. {{PRONOUN-0}} displayed good eye contact and social reciprocity via video interview. {{CHILD-NAME}} was talkative and eager to share information about {{PRONOUN-2}} interests (e.g., basketball and food). {{PRONOUN-2}} speech was normal in pace, rate, and volume. {{CHILD-NAME}} presented as euthymic with full range of affective expression, which appeared congruent with the situation. {{PRONOUN-2}} reported mood was “XX.” {{PRONOUN-2}} thought process was logical, and no flight of ideas or loose associations were evident. {{PRONOUN-0}} denied any hallucinations, delusions, obsessive thoughts or compulsive actions, and further denied any current suicidal thoughts, ideation, intent or plan.

Due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant social distancing guidelines, this assessment was conducted using remote administration methods, including remote audiovisual presentation of test instructions and test stimuli, and remote observation of performance via audiovisual technology. Modification to standardized procedures included presentation of stimulus materials via screensharing according to current guidelines. The following factors were closely monitored in order to ensure the appropriateness of each test’s administration:
• Setting (i.e., pre-test audio-video set-up, high-speed connectivity, high-quality video and audio [i.e., Microsoft Teams], use of screensharing, screen size, peripheral camera use, managed distractions, and lighting);
• Examiner training;
• Examinee behavior monitoring and response; and
• Protection of the tests and test materials.

The remote testing environment appeared free of distractions, adequate rapport was established with the examinee via video, and the examinee appeared appropriately engaged in the task throughout the session. No significant/Mild/Moderate/Interfering technological problems were noted during administration; the internet connection cut out at times and necessitated repeating of instructions or test items.

{{CHILD-NAME}} required some support to maintain {{PRONOUN-2}} attention during the sessions, including reminders to not swivel in {{PRONOUN-2}} chair and look at the screen. Toward the end of the session, {{CHILD-NAME}} needed support and encouragement to continue. {{PRONOUN-0}} responded well to short breaks and use of a self-completed checklist which broke down the activities into smaller parts and provided structure and reinforcement. {{PRONOUN-2}} motor activity level was noted to be high/ within normal limits. {{PRONOUN-0}} understood the task instructions easily and did not require further elaboration. {{CHILD-NAME}} appeared to put forth full effort during testing however {{PRONOUN-0}} did display mildly low tolerance for frustration.

{{CHILD-NAME}} was able to maintain {{PRONOUN-2}} attention during the sessions. {{PRONOUN-2}} motor activity level was noted to be within normal limits. {{PRONOUN-0}} understood the task instructions easily and did not require further elaboration. {{CHILD-NAME}} appeared to put forth full effort during testing and displayed good tolerance for frustration. For instance, {{PRONOUN-0}} tried to guess on difficult items and did not give up easily. No outward signs of anxiety were noted.

The administered subtests have received initial validation in several samples for remote telepractice and digital format administration. Thus, considering minimal technological interference, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s effort and positive response to structure and redirection, the results are considered a relatively valid description of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s skills and abilities; however, the impact of applying non-standard administration methods has been evaluated only in part by scientific research. While every effort was made to simulate standard assessment practices, the diagnostic conclusions and recommendations for treatment provided in this report are being advanced with these reservations.

### Clinical Summary Validity Statement

Testing was completed over the course of two remote sessions, to gain insight into {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall intellectual ability, language and academic skills. This assessment was conducted using telehealth methods. The standard administration of these procedures involves in-person, face-to-face methods. The impact of applying non-standard administration methods has been evaluated only in part by scientific research. While every effort was made to simulate standard assessment practices, the diagnostic conclusions and recommendations for treatment provided in this report are being advanced with these reservations.

### Cognitive Summary

On the WISC-V, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall level of general intellectual function was in the **\_** range, as measured by the Nonmotor Full Scale Score (NMFSS). Specifically, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated appropriately developed verbal comprehension (i.e., understanding of verbal concepts and vocabulary knowledge) and fluid reasoning (i.e., using logic to solve problems and identifying connections between abstract concepts). {{PRONOUN-2}} nonmotor visual spatial processing (i.e., evaluating visual details/spatial relationships) was also within normal limits. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance was also within normal limits on cognitive proficiency measures, including auditory working memory (i.e., recalling, manipulating, and sequencing information) and naming speed (i.e., automaticity of naming familiar objects, colors, letters, and numbers).

### NMGAI

On the WISC-V, {{CHILD-NAME}}’s overall level of general intellectual function was in the average range, as measured by the Nonmotor Full Scale Score. Of note, there was wide variability between {{CHILD-NAME}}’s scores; {{PRONOUN-2}} general reasoning ability with verbal and nonverbal information (NMGAI), was comparatively higher than {{PRONOUN-2}} cognitive proficiency scores. The Nonmotor General Ability Index (NMGAI), combines measures of Verbal Comprehension, Nonmotor Visual-Spatial processing and Fluid Reasoning. This score differs from the Nonmotor Full Scale IQ in that it is not influenced by {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance on auditory working memory and naming speed tasks (i.e., executive functioning). {{CHILD-NAME}}’s NMGAI standard score placed in the high average range (SS=XX, XX %ile).

### Academic Summary

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s level of academic achievement was assessed using subtests of the WIAT-4 and TOWRE-2. {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated appropriately developed reading skills, including sight word recognition, decoding, reading fluency and comprehension. In math, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated average skills in applied problem solving (e.g. visually presented word problems, measurement, charts/graphs, time, money). On a measure of spelling skills, {{CHILD-NAME}} performed in the average range.

### Language summary

{{CHILD-NAME}}’s language and phonological skills were assessed on several measures; On the WIAT-4 tests of listening comprehension, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated XX ability to comprehend orally presented passages and vocabulary. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s phonological processing, a skill predictive of reading, language, and overall achievement, was measured by select subtests of the CTOPP-2; {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated XX skills on measures of phonological memory, phonological awareness and rapid naming skills. It is important to note that the validity of phonological tests may be compromised by the remote administration as it is difficult to ensure that auditory testing stimuli are heard clearly and that responses are scored accurately. As such, the phonological scores should particularly be interpreted with caution.

## In Person Testing with Social Distancing

### MSE and Behavior Obs

Due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and resultant social distancing guidelines, face-to-face testing with modifications to standardized testing procedures was conducted. Precautionary steps were designed to help safeguard participants, families, and staff (e.g., symptom surveys, staggered appointments, increased disinfecting of commonly touched surfaces). Modification to standardized procedures for in-person testing included use of PPE (e.g., face mask, face shield, gloves) for all participants, families, and staff according to current guidelines. The following factors were closely monitored in order to ensure the appropriateness of each test’s administration:
• Setting (i.e., spaced out chairs and tables; use of plastic sheet protectors to place over paper stimulus book pages; use of hand sanitizer before and after tasks for which gloves would not be appropriate);
• Examiner training;
• Examinee behavior monitoring and response; and
• Protection and sanitation of the tests and test materials.

### CTOPP Validity

It is important to note that the validity of phonological tests may be compromised by the administration of tests with masks, as it is difficult to ensure that auditory testing stimuli are heard clearly and that responses are scored accurately. As such, the phonological scores should be particularly interpreted with caution.

## Mix of Remote and in-person testing

### Pre covid in person and remote

#### Testing Behavior Observations

Due to the CoViD-19 pandemic and resultant social distancing guidelines, part of this evaluation was administered via remote telepractice using digital stimulus materials with strict adherence to guidelines. Tests administered remotely are denoted as such in the list under “Performance Testing and Standardized Questionnaire Results.” Modification to standardized procedures for remote telepractice included presentation of stimulus materials via screensharing according to current guidelines. The following factors were closely monitored in order to ensure the appropriateness of each test’s administration:
• Setting for remote testing (i.e., pre-test audio-video set-up, high-speed connectivity, high-quality video and audio [i.e., Microsoft Teams], use of screensharing, screen size, peripheral camera use, managed distractions, and lighting)
• Setting for in-person testing with social distancing (i.e., spaced out chairs and tables; use of plastic sheet protectors to place over paper stimulus book pages; use of hand sanitizer before and after tasks for which gloves would not be appropriate);
• Examiner training;
• Examinee behavior monitoring and response; and
• Protection of the tests and test materials.

### In office (after reopening) plus remote

#### Testing Behavior Observations

Due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and resultant social distancing guidelines, part of this evaluation was administered via remote telepractice using digital stimulus materials with strict adherence to guidelines. Tests administered remotely are denoted as such in the list under “Performance Testing and Standardized Questionnaire Results.” Research has documented similar psychometric properties for testing conducted face-to-face in office and via remote telepractice. Part of this evaluation was also conducted in-person with the implementation of social distancing, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and disinfecting procedures.

Modification to standardized procedures for remote testing included the presentation of stimulus materials via screensharing according to current guidelines. For in-person sessions, precautionary steps were designed to help safeguard patients, families, and staff (e.g., symptom surveys, staggered appointments, and increased disinfecting of commonly touched surfaces).

# GFTA Scores

## Template 1: No Difficulties

On the GFTA-3, no notable difficulties were observed with articulation.

## Template 2: Below Age Lvl Expectations

### Standard

On the GFTA-3, results suggest that articulation was below age level expectations, and further evaluation to understand the nature and severity of impairment is indicated.

### Template 2-R: Difficulties with /R/

On the GFTA-3, results suggest that articulation was below age level expectations. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s errors were primarily characterized by difficulty with the phoneme ‘r’, both in the beginning of words, as in “red”, and in the end of words, as in “finger”, as well as in consonant clusters, as in “brush”. While considered a later developing sound, by {{PRONOUN-2}} chronological age, these phonemes are expected to be mastered. Further evaluation to understand the nature and severity of impairment is indicated.

### Template 2-S: Difficulties with /S/

On the GFTA-3, results suggest that articulation was below age level expectations. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s errors were primarily characterized by interdental placement of the phoneme /s/, commonly referred to as a lisp. This error impacts /s/ in the beginning of the word, as in “soap”, the middle of the word, as in “glasses”, and the end of the word, as in “house”, as well as in consonant clusters, as in “slide” and “swing”. Although this pattern is common in younger children, this error is no longer expected at {{CHILD-NAME}}’s chronological age. Further evaluation to understand the nature and severity of impairment is indicated.

### Template 2-S/L: Difficulties with Lisp

On the GFTA-3, results suggest that articulation was below age level expectations. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s errors were primarily characterized by distortions on affricate and fricative sounds characterized by a lateral air flow, commonly called a lateral lisp. While this distortion has limited impact on speech intelligibility, it is an atypical error. Further evaluation to understand the nature and severity of impairment is indicated.

## Low GFTA

### Extremely low articulation, interfered with phonological testing 


### Lisp did not interfere with testing,

However, on the GFTA-3, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated deficits in {{PRONOUN-2}} articulation of sounds and words. Per observation, {{PRONOUN-2}} lisp did not interfere with intelligibility. Nevertheless, continued speech therapy is recommended in order to improve {{PRONOUN-2}} articulation.

### Slightly below average articulation, variable phonological processing

Alternatively, on the GFTA-3, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated slightly below average articulation of words. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s phonological processing, a skill predictive of reading, language, and overall achievement, was variable as measured by select subtests of the CTOPP-2; {{PRONOUN-0}} demonstrated skills ranging from low to average in measures of phonological memory, phonological awareness and rapid naming skills. Further speech/language assessment can be considered if impairment resulting from articulation is noted.
