# Reading 

## Reading Strategies 

***Reading Strategies***
1. **Daily Reading:** Encourage Childname to read at least 15 minutes a day on a topic of interest.  You can set up an incentive program in order to increase Childname’s motivation and effort in reading. In this system, Childname is awarded points at home for reading on a daily basis. 
2. **Phonological Processing/Decoding:** 
    - Teach Childname how to use structural analysis to decode multisyllabic words. Ensure Childname “over learns” these skills so that he/she begins to see unfamiliar words as a sequence of recognizable word parts. Teach Childname to identify both meaningful parts (prefixes, suffixes, and root words) and pronunciation parts (common clusters and syllables). 
    - Teach structural analysis by cutting apart words into common clusters. Keep the letters of the words you are working with large. Combine the word parts in a variety of ways to make pseudowords or real words to pronounce. Let Childname then scramble the letters to make new words for you to pronounce. 
    - When pronouncing multisyllabic words, have Childname slide his/her index finger slowly under the word parts as he/she pronounces them. 
3. **Reading Fluency:** 
    - **Multimodal Approach:** Use a variety of methods to increase Childname’s reading fluency such as repeated readings, choral reading, speed drills, practicing with taped books, and reading decodable text. Provide short, frequent periods of practice and concrete, visible measures of progress (e.g., charts, bar graphs). Reading the same passage or book repeatedly can increase Childname’s fluency. Childname can read the first passage into an audio recording device and between readings work out the words that gave Childname difficulty.  
    - **Dolch Sight Words:** Teach and drill Childname common, high frequency words such as the Dolch sight words and the Magic 100 Words. By learning such words, Childname will learn to automatically recognize many words in print without having to use strategies to decode. Because many learners benefit from having information presented in a context, connect these words to words and information Childname already knows.  
    - **Rapid Word Recognition Chart:** Use this to improve speed and accuracy for pronouncing irregular words. The chart is similar to a rapid serial naming task. It is a matrix that contains five rows of six exception words (such as “who” and “said”) with each row containing the same six words in a different order. After a warm up or brief review of the words, students are timed for 1 minute as they read aloud the words in the squares. Students can then count and record the number of words read correctly. Once Childname can read all words easily and quickly, new words can be written in the chart. 
    - **Closed Captioning:** Watch television with closed captioning on in order to help promote vocabulary acquisition and retention. This method allows Childname to match the sound of a word to its written form. 
4. **Reading Comprehension:** 
    - **SQ3R Method:** Childname would benefit from learning SQ3R reading method. This method is named for its five steps: survey, questions, read, recite, and review. 
    - **Reciprocal Teaching:** Teachers may utilize research-based models such as Reciprocal Teaching. This instructional procedure is designed to teach students cognitive strategies that might lead to improved reading comprehension. The learning of strategies such as summarization, question generation, clarification, and prediction is supported through dialogue between teacher and students as they attempt to gain meaning from text. 
    - **Collaborative Strategic Reading:** The research-based comprehension model Collaborative Strategic Reading teaches skills to aid comprehension before, during and after reading a text. The four strategies follow: preview the text, decide whether one understands the text, identify the most important ideas, and generate questions and answers about the information in the text. 
    - **Elaboration** and Rehearsal: Elaboration is the process of explicitly making associations between prior knowledge and new information. These strategies encourage the student to think about the information deeply, rather than just superficially, by elaborating on the information in such a way as to understand its full meaning. When properly utilized, research has demonstrated strong improvements in recall among student learners.1 
    - **Underlining:** In terms of reading longer and more complex reading material, Childname needs to learn strategies such as underlining key ideas. At the end of each page, Childname needs to reread what he/she has underlined. He/She might even do the rereading into a tape recorder in order to review it at a later time. 
    - **Paraphrase:** Childname should be encouraged to paraphrase during class discussions and while reading something important. Related to paraphrasing is the skill of note taking. This ability can also enhance registration.   
    - **Previewing: Previewing technical or difficult vocabulary or concepts before Childname reads an assignment or having a glossary of words and concepts to use while reading, would enhance his/her comprehension. Such a list provides a preview of the content and prevents him/her from becoming too confused as new words and ideas appear.  
    - **Make up questions:** After reading a text, Childname should be encouraged to write questions about what he/she has read. Childname might pretend they are making up a test on the material.   
    - **Graphic Organizers:** Childname’s parents and teachers can assist in making diagrams and charts to summarize the material in textbooks as well as help his/her use of word and conceptual maps and advance organizers when reading textbooks. Childname can fill in a list of questions written before he/she reads longer passages in textbooks. Alternatively, Childname could be given a skeleton of a diagram and asked to fill it in during or after the reading of a passage. 
    - **Repeated Readings:** Childname should read text multiple times. 
    - **Highlighting:** Highlighting key text sentences and phrases will help Childname differentiate important information that should be remembered for deeper understanding. Highlighted text also serves as a usual tool to reference important information when reviewing or studying material. 
    - **Circling Unknown Words:** Childname would benefit from identifying unfamiliar words by circling them in text and looking up the definitions. This will help improve Childname’s reading comprehension and strengthen his/her vocabulary.  
    - **Comprehension Checking:** Childname should practice repeating or paraphrasing what he/she has heard or understood in order to check for accuracy and to provide an opportunity for rehearsal.   
    - **Annotating text:** Marking the pages of a text with notes is an important active reading strategy that achieves many goals. Text annotations make it easy to find key information and help to organize information, themes, and ideas. Annotations will also help Childname engage in critical thinking skills, as they provide a way for him/her to note comments, connections, questions, or other reactions as he/she reads.  Different types of annotations are: 
        - Clearly identifying important ideas and information 
        - Expressing and recording main ideas 
        - Providing evidence for the development of ideas throughout a text 
        - Noting the reader’s thoughts and reactions 
        - Marking complicated or confusing portions of the text for further clarification 

## Spelling 

***Spelling***
1. Teach Childname the most common spelling rules (e.g., when a word ending in -y is made plural, drop the -y and add -ies; u always follows q; when adding an ending starting with a vowel, double the final consonant to maintain the short vowel sound). Reinforce generalization to words in classroom writing.
2. Teach spelling and reading patterns simultaneously so that they are mutually reinforcing (e.g., teach the cvc pattern and have Childname read and spell words that have this pattern). 
3. **Computer:** Provide opportunities for Childname to practice his/her spelling words on the computer. 
4. **Break Words Into Sounds:** As spelling skill develops, encourage Childname to listen to the sounds in words and then try to write the sounds that he/she hears in order. This will help him/her increase understanding of the relationships between spoken and written words. 
5. **Audio Recorder:** Have Childname study spelling words using an audio recorder. Use the following steps: (a) have Childname look at the word while hearing it pronounced; (b) have him/her look at the word while hearing it spelled letter by letter; (c) repeatedly spell the word aloud with the tape until he/she can write it from memory; (d) have Childname write the word from memory 3 times, checking for accuracy after each attempt. 

## Assistive Technology

***Assistive Technology for Reading***
1. **Text-to-speech (TTS) Apps:** These allow students to see text and hear it aloud at the same time. To use these tools, students click on a highlighted word(s), and the words are read aloud by a computer-generated voice. TTS may be used with any digital text (i.e., books, emails, web pages), and can be used to convert text files to audio files. Low cost apps are available for download on tablets and smartphones, such as:

# Math 

## Mathematics Strategies 

***Mathematics Strategies***
1. **Fluency Training:** Math drills reinforce fluency with operations such as single digit addition and subtraction. 
2. **Use of Visuals** Use visual methods to help Childname solve math word problems and to teach new concepts and reinforce skills. Visuals help represent concretely abstract mathematical material.
3. **Direct and explicit instruction:** Teach any problem-solving strategy as directly and as explicitly as you would any academic skills, providing for instruction and ample guided and independent practice, monitoring for misunderstandings and errors.  
4. **Verbal Explanations:** Provide Childname with an index card that contains clear verbal explanations of questions to ask as he/she works math problems. For example, when learning regrouping techniques for subtraction, write the question "Is the top number larger than the bottom number?" If yes – subtract, If no - regroup (borrow). 
5. **Memory Strategies:** Teach Childname memory strategies for performing new math algorithms in the correct sequence. For example, for long division, teach him/her to write the symbols representing the steps at the top of his/her paper, to recite, “Divide, multiply, subtract, check, bring down,” or make a tune for it and sing it.  
6. **Color Coding:** Use color coding to: (a) identify starting and stopping places within a problem; (b) code the units, tens, hundreds, and thousands place; (c) indicate where the final answer should be written; and (d) highlight important features, such as operation signs, the question being asked, or the key information being asked in the problem. 
7. **Flash Cards:** Have a peer or parent provide practice sessions with flash cards, so that Childname can become automatic with his/her math facts. 
8. **Online Tools:** 
    1. Math is Fun (https://www.mathsisfun.com/)- resource for k-12 students and teachers 
    2. Illuminations (https://illuminations.nctm.org/)- interactive tolls for students and teachers 
    3. Cool Math (https://www.coolmath.com/) games for algebra and calculus 
    4. Cool Math for kids (https://www.coolmath4kids.com/) 
    5. The “24” Game (https://www.4nums.com/) 
9. **Math Problem Solving Strategies:**  
    1. Childname is more likely to understand word problems and find solutions if he/she can relate to their content. As much as possible, make problems relevant to Childname’s life. 
    2. Help Childname learn to identify extraneous information in word problems. With a marker, have him/her cross out any extraneous information before he/she attempts to solve a problem. 
    3. Ensure that when Childname is asked to solve story problems, the computation involved is not difficult. This will allow Childname to concentrate on understanding the language of the problem. 
    4. As Childname appears to misinterpret word problems, have him/her restate the problem in his/her own words and identify the givens and the problem goal before planning the solution. 
    5. Teach Childname a simple strategy to use for solving story problems. For example (a) read the problem, (b) reread the problem to identify what is given (What do I know?) and to decide what is asked for (What do I need to find out?), (c) use objects to solve the problem and identify the operation to use, (d) write the problem, and (e) work the problem. Write the strategy on an index card for easy reference. 
    6. Teach Childname how to recognize when he/she does not have all of the information needed to solve a problem. For example, give Childname word problems in which specific information needed to solve the problem is missing. Have him/her identify what is missing, provide the information, and then solve the problem. 
    7. Encourage him/her to read each problem carefully and ask him/herself whether he/she has seen a similar problem before. Help him/her learn to identify key operation words such as those for addition (e.g., sum, total, in all), subtraction (e.g., difference, how much more), and multiplication (e.g., product, total, times) and break down the steps to solving the problems. Guide him/her in applying the steps and in reflecting on his/her work. Model these steps for Childname and have him/her practice applying this approach on his/her own. 
10. **Assistive Technology:** Students who struggle with rote math skills or more complex word problem solving, may benefit from the use of AT. Low cost or free apps are available for download on tablets and smartphones such as:  
    1. *ModMath* helps students work on math problems without using a pencil by giving the user a piece of virtual graph paper. When they click on the cell, users can type in numbers, math operations, and equations, allowing everything to be automatically aligned, clear, and legible. The problems can then be saved, emailed, or printed.  
    2. *Dexteria Dots—Get in Touch With Math* uses the app’s touch interface to teach students math concepts by combining different “dots”. Each dot has a numeric value that corresponds to its size (i.e., the 6 dot is bigger than the 4 dot). For example, if the program challenges the user to produce the value 9, they have to provide a solution within the time allotted. There are several different skill levels, and most problems have multiple solutions. Price: $2.99. 
    3. *Kurzweil 3000:* is a comprehensive educational software which includes text-to-speech with natural voices, the ability to read text from different media (e.g., word, PDF, and websites), access to traditional dictionaries and picture/talking dictionaries, and helps create study guides.  Additional features assist in writing by providing access to graphic organizers, word prediction, word lists, spell check, and speech-to-text.  Features also assist in math by providing a talking calculator.	 

## Math Organization 

***Math Organization***
The following strategies can address Childname’s difficulty with organization in numerical calculations;  
1. **Verbal Explanations:** Provide Childname with an index card that contains clear verbal explanations of questions to ask himself/herself as he/she works math problems. For example, when learning regrouping techniques for subtraction, write the question "Is the top number larger than the bottom number?"      
    If yes – subtract, If no - regroup (borrow) 
2. **Memory Strategies:** Teach Childname memory strategies for performing new math algorithms in the correct sequence. For example, for long division, teach him/her to write the symbols representing the steps at the top of her paper, to recite, “Divide, multiply, subtract, check, bring down,” or make a tune for it and sing it. The figure to the right shows a visual cue for long division. 
3. **Color Coding:** Use color coding to: (a) identify starting and stopping places within a problem; (b) code the units, tens, hundreds, and thousands place; (c) indicate where the final answer should be written; and (d) highlight important features, such as operation signs, the question being asked, or the key information being asked in the problem. 
4. The arrangement of math assignments need to be simplified (no credit should be lost for a correct answer placed in the wrong column or space). Whenever possible, use of graph paper is recommended to keep columns aligned in written math assignments. 

## Math Anxiety 
***Math Anxiety***
Childname reportedly displays low self-esteem related to mathematics, which can interfere with his/her performance. The following strategies can alleviate strains on working memory and increase self-efficacy in math;  
1. **Create a mnemonic:** A mnemonic is a kind of memory device that helps a person remember information she might otherwise forget. When faced with a complicated equation, like: 10 + ( 5 x 52 ) – 15, students might use the mnemonic Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally to help them remember where to begin calculating. Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally represents the correct order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction. 
2. **Write out important information before you begin your test:** Having a mnemonic is a good first step, but as soon as you get a copy of your test, or as soon as you begin working on homework for the night, it’s a good idea to write down the facts or equations that you will need to remember. That way you can refer back to them if you are feeling confused or need reassurance. Writing them out on a piece of paper, reduces some of the working memory load, which in turn can reduce anxiety 
3. **Try thinking verbally:** For kids who have better verbal abilities, just being able to talk out their strategy and give a good explanation of what they want to do and how they should solve it, and maybe getting corrective feedback along the way, can be really helpful. Similarly, students can write out their strategy during homework or a test. In this approach students are walking themselves through how to think about the problem, at their own pace and in language they might feel more comfortable in. With this technique they might find that they understand more than they realize about how to solve the problem and switching to a more verbal approach helps them think more clearly. 
4. **Switching mindset:** Resetting how Childname thinks about math can be helpful. If kids think that math isn’t for them, they aren’t going to feel hopeful or even motivated about learning.  People with a fixed mindset perceive failure as proof of their limits — obviously they can’t succeed at this.  People with a growth mindset, on the other hand, believe that their abilities can improve with hard work, and may interpret a failure as a sign that they should try harder next time. Research shows that students with a growth mindset show more persistence and get better grades 
5. **Praising hard work:** Parents and teachers can help kids become more resilient learners by changing how we praise children and adjusting what we think of as a successful learning experience. Praise them for the work that they put in, not for the grade that they get 
6. **Doing math together at home:** Just like it’s a good idea to read to your children, it’s also a good idea for you to do math together. Of course, parents often have their own anxieties about math. As with any other kind of anxiety, it’s important to try not to pass on your fears to your children. You can consider making math part of your bedtime routine. You might want to use Bedtime Math or a similar resource for ideas. Every day the Bedtime Math website and app features a new child-friendly math anecdote and related questions to pose to children of different ages and abilities. Ideas for doing math together include: 
    - Count things: Legos, napkins, sides on a square, etc. 
    - During cooking talk about fractions (half of a pepper, three-quarters of a cup of flour) and practice doubling and halving ingredients in a recipe. 
    - Practice totaling a check and figuring out a tip together. 
    - Discuss patterns and shapes. 
    - Measure things using a ruler. 
    - Compare prices of items at the store. 
7. **Handling difficult homework questions:** When a child asks question about homework, especially when the homework is getting advanced or it’s been a long time since you’ve thought about it, it’s okay to say you don’t know. Saying ‘I don’t know’ can actually reduce a lot of the anxiety about having the right answers. You can also say, “Let’s look it up together and find out.” That way you’re also modeling the best way to respond when you don’t know something  

# Writing 

## Writing Strategies 

***Writing Strategies***
1. **Use of Word Processor:** Provide Childname with instruction and daily practice in using a word processing program until he/she is proficient at typing and using the program functions that he/she will need most often (e.g., spell checker, moving and revising text, saving, setting up files, printing). 
2. **Electronic Writing Programs:** These programs facilitate written output by either allowing a child to generate a story by speaking into a microphone and/or providing structured ideas and prompts as they write. These programs are recommended given that laborious handwriting can undermine a child’s thought process during writing. These supportive programs may reduce the interference of handwriting frustration and/or the risk of losing track of his/her thoughts or good ideas as he/she is concentrating on forming individual letters. Examples of available programs include: Kidspiration, Cowriter, SOLO LiteracySuite, and Write On.  
3. **Prewriting Strategies:** Using graphic organizers, teach Childname how to organize his/her ideas and details into topic areas or generate subtopics related to the main topic and add details. Help him/her to recognize information that does not belong to any of the subtopics. 
4. **Topics of Interest:** Let Childname select topics that are familiar and interesting to him/her. Allow him/her to discuss a chosen topic with peers to get their information, record it, and incorporate it into his/her writing. 
5. **Key Words:** Prior to writing, brainstorm any words or phrases that he/she thinks he/she may want to use in his/her paper. List all the words on the board or a piece of paper. As skill improves, you may designate specific categories of words, such as action or descriptive words. 
6. **Use of Slant Board:** To address poor penmanship and/or difficulty in writing, the use of a slant board or angled board has shown to improve writing skills.  More specifically, the slant board is useful in addressing the following: wrist extension, posture, visual processing and learning, improved motor control, increases paper stability, and copying skills. 

## Assistive Technology

***Assistive Technology for Writing***
Students who struggle with either the fine motor skill of writing or with the content and organization of written expression benefit significantly from the use of assistive technology, including:  
1. **Word Processing Tools**, including a basic keyboard and word processing software (such as Microsoft Word or Pages) are of particular benefit to users who struggle with the task of writing. Individuals can improve keyboarding skills with software programs and websites geared toward their developmental level and interests such as Typing Instructor and Typing Instructor for Kids, Mavis Beacon Keyboarding Kidz, and All The Right Type.

## Letter Reversals 

***Letter Reversals***
1. Provide cues to help him/her remember the orientation of letters and numbers but do not be concerned about a developmental weakness at this time. 
2. Because children can become anxious about their letter reversals in writing, do not bring attention to them. Treat reversals as spelling errors that will be corrected during the editing stage of writing. 
3. Provide Childname with a visual cue for recalling the orientation of frequently confused letters.  
    - To help the him/her distinguish between b and d, draw an association between the letter b and the word baseball. Tell the student, “If you want to play baseball, first you need a bat.” Draw an upright bat and then the loop as a ball. Have him/her memorize, “First, you need a bat.” Otherwise, you can only play catch. 
    - Show him/her that the letter b can be formed with the fingers of the left hand and d with the right. Teach him/her that since the alphabet is written from left to right and b comes first in the alphabet, b is the letter made with the left hand. Since the letter d comes after b, it is made with the right hand. Give him/her practice in using this trick so that the differentiation becomes automatic. 
    - Provide him/her with cards that include keywords containing frequently reversed letters, such as dog for d, that he/she may keep at his/her desk and refer to when writing. 
    - Teach him/her how to form the letter b using a forward circle (clockwise) and the letter d using a backward circle (counterclockwise). 
    - Show him/her how to check his/her papers for b/d reversals. By turning the paper to the right, a correctly formed b will look like the start of a pair of glasses. 
    - Help him/her recall the orientation of letters by using language clues. 
    - Remind him/her that a lowercase b is just a capital B that has lost its top. 
    - Draw a bed made of the letters b, e, and d, with the b as the headboard and the d as the footboard. When he/she says the word “bed” and either looks at or imagines the picture, he/she will recall that the first letter has the /b/ sound and the last letter has the /d/ sound. 
4. After identifying the letters that Childname reverses, have him/her practice one letter daily in different applications. For example, have him/her trace the letter and write it from memory, write several keywords that contain the letter, and circle as many of the letter that he/she can find in a magazine or newspaper article. At the end of the week, check to see that he/she is able to recognize and write the specific letters that he/she has been practicing. 
5. Provide Childname with practice of letters that he/she frequently reverses. Present a model of the correctly formed letters, followed by the letter formed several times with a series of dots. Gradually fade out the dots so that he/she forms the letter independently. 
6. To reduce reversals in writing, have Childname describe aloud the movement pattern he/she makes when writing a frequently reversed letter. For example, when forming the letter b, he/she may say: "start high, line down, back up and around."  
7. Based upon his/her frequent letter reversals, teach Childname cursive writing. Provide oral cues as you teach letter formation. 
8. To help Childname recall the direction of numerals, relate their orientation to an analog clock face. Show him/her that 2, 3, 4, and 7 always start at 11:00. The figure to the right is an example using the number 2. 
9. Teach Childname how to position his/her paper correctly. [For a right-handed writer, the bottom left-hand corner should point at his/her navel. For a left-handed writer, the paper runs parallel to the writing arm like a railroad track.] 
10. Show Childname how to hold his/her paper steady with the alternate hand when writing. 
11. Provide Childname with a clipboard to use in writing activities. This will make writing easier because the paper will remain in a consistent position.

## Executive Functioning

***Executive Functioning*** 
Executive functioning is the ability to organize and manage one’s own behavior. The following interventions and strategies can improve various domains of executive skills.  
1. **Tools and Applications:** The following are planning, cueing and time management applications that help break down projects and keep focused on a task:  
    1. *MotivAider:* this self-improvement device periodically vibrates to remind the user about a habit he/she is trying to change. In the case of attention deficits, it vibrates and users can ask themselves whether they are paying attention, thus, serving as a reminder to stay focused. Available at http://habitchange.com/motivaider.php  
    2. *Randominder:* this application helps individuals stay focused and complete tasks on time. Available at http://appcrawlr.com/ios/randominder  
    3. *Time Timer:* this visual timer shows the passage of time through a red disk that disappears as time elapses. Choose among watches, clocks, and applications. Available at www.timetimer.com 
    4. *WatchMinder:* this wristwatch provides discrete vibrating cues and reminders throughout the day. Individuals can choose pre-programmed messages or create their own personalized messages. Available at www.watchminder.com 
    5. *Daily Routine:* This app can help Childname create daily routines and stick to them. 
    6. *30/30:* This is a task manager app. Available at www.3030.binaryhammer.com 
    7.*Wunderlist:* This app helps in planning and prioritizing personal tasks, and includes built in reminders. Available at www.wunderlist.com 
2. **Sustaining Attention:** 
    1. A child with difficulties sustaining attention often needs frequent short breaks. Breaks typically need only be 1 or 2 minutes. Observing when a child’s ability to focus begins to wane will help determine the optimal time for a break. “Attentional” or “Brain breaks” are best taken with a motor activity or a relaxing activity. They might walk to the pencil sharpener, run a short errand, get a drink, or simply bring his/her work to show his/her teacher. Physical activity sensory breaks such as wall push-ups or jumping jacks may also be effective.  
    2. Teaching a child to “chunk” information may be useful in helping him/her increase the amount that he/she can learn or capture at one time. It may be necessary for his/her teachers or parents to help him/her learn how to approach new information as sets or groups of details, rather than as a single series, in order to facilitate chunking and retention of material. 
    3. Children should be offered hands-on, experiential learning opportunities, since traditional didactic teaching approaches can strain their capacity for attention. 
    4. Changing tasks more frequently can alleviate some of the drain on attention. Provide choices when possible, at teacher discretion (i.e., completing reading before math). 
    5. Given the negative impact of competing information on attention, it is important to reduce distractions in the environment. When this is not possible, providing him/her with a privacy board may be effective. 
    6. Providing a written checklist of steps required to complete a task can serve as an external memory support and alleviate some of the burden on attention. 
    7. Teach the child to use external cues in his/her environment and ask what is expected of them (e.g., What am I doing? What are others doing around me? What should I be doing?). 
3. **Processing Speed:** Provide activities designed to increase rate of production, such as recording the starting and stopping times or using a stopwatch. Also, for each assignment, have the child record the amount of time it took him/her to complete the assignment. This will allow you to monitor the quantity of homework assigned. 
4. **Monitoring:** It may be helpful to build in editing or reviewing as an integral part of every task in order to increase error recognition and correction. Setting goals for accuracy rather than speed can help increase attention to errors. Reward the child for accuracy to support continued focus on monitoring his/her work. You can also ask him/her to predict how well he/she will do on a particular task, then compare his/her prediction with the actual outcome in order to increase his/her awareness of his/her strengths and weaknesses. Encourage the child to chart his/her performance and/or behavior in order to provide a tangible record of activity for ongoing monitoring. 
5. **Initiation:** External prompting may be necessary to help children get started. A teacher might stop by his/her desk at the outset of each task and prompt him/her to start his/her work, or perhaps demonstrate the first problem of a worksheet. Peers can also often help serve as models to help get started on tasks. Working in pairs or in small groups may be helpful, as peers will serve as external cues. Lastly, problems with initiating may be exacerbated by a sense of being overwhelmed with a given task. Breaking tasks into smaller, more structured steps may reduce his/her sense of being overwhelmed and increase initiation. 
6. **Inhibition:** A student with inhibitory control difficulties often requires additional structure in his/her environment at the outset in order to maintain more appropriately controlled behavior. Children might need a more explicit, extensive, and/or clear set of rules and expectations, and might need these reviewed with him/her regularly. Response delay techniques can also be helpful for disinhibition. Children might be taught strategies such as counting to 5 before responding verbally or physically. Several “stop and think” methods are available that teach students to inhibit their initial response, consider the potential consequences of their behaviors, and further develop an approach to a situation.   
7. **Organization and Planning:** Children may benefit from learning to use an organizational system or daily planner. Some students can benefit from having a checklist of needed materials to review on a daily basis before leaving home for school, and/or at the end of the school day. Having an extra set of books at home can be a simple yet effective means of ensuring that he/she has the required materials for completing his/her assignments. 
8. **Shifting/Adapting:** Children who struggle to adapt and shift between expectations can benefit from the following strategies:  
    1. *Display schedule:* Use visual organizers, such as pictures, schedules, planners, and calendar boards. This will let him/her know the order of activities for the day, and can alert him/her to variations in the usual sequence before they occur.  
    2. *Adjust routines gradually:* Adherence to routines and resistance to change may reflect a child’s need for predictability in his/her environment. An essential tenet of intervention is to facilitate feelings of security by maintaining a set of basic routines, then adjusting routines slightly in a stepwise fashion. Larger steps may cause distress.  
    3. *2-minute warning:* Teachers can alert children that one activity is about to end and another will begin. Allowing a few minutes of “down time” or leisure activity between the end of one activity and the beginning of the next can facilitate transitions, when possible.  
    4. *Time Limits:* Children might work on one activity or assignment for a set period then an alternative activity for the next period. Use of a timer can facilitate a child’s adjustment to change in activity. 

## Emotional and Behavioral Regulation

***Emotional and Behavioral Regulation***
Children who have difficulty regulating their behavior and/or emotions often benefit from the following communication techniques and strategies; 
1. **Positive Reinforcement Program:** Set up a school-home cooperative incentive program in order to increase motivation and effort. In this system, the child is awarded points at school for demonstrating specific behavior; a note, point paper or behavior chart is sent home daily; and rewards or mild negative consequences are provided at home.  Regular communication between the teacher and parents is critical.  
2. **Stable Routine:** Parents should provide a consistent, stable routine in both the morning and evening. In the morning, the child should have the opportunity to arrive on time to school.  In the evening, provide quiet time to settle-down after a day spent in a busy classroom.  
3. **Model Self-Regulation:** Parents can explicitly demonstrate appropriate means for controlling one’s emotional reactions and impulsive responses. Draw attention to the use of effective strategies such as taking a deep breath in the face of frustration, thinking before responding, evaluating consequences, and making cool-headed decisions.  
4. **Self-Statements:** Encourage children to employ self-statements around delayed gratification and suppressing impulsive responses. At first parents may have to model these types of statements and encourage repetition. For example, if the child wants a cookie before dinner, his/her parents can encourage him/her to say, “I want a cookie now, but I have to wait until after dinner.” One way of coping with this delay in gratification might be distracting the child with an interesting puzzle or challenge.  
5. **Communication Techniques:**  
    - Tell, do not ask, Childname what you want him/her to do.  
    - Stand within 3 feet of Childname and obtain eye contact before giving him/her a request or directive. Speak in a quiet voice. 
    - Make a request or give a directive no more than twice. If Childname does not comply the second time, immediately institute a preplanned consequence.  
    - When making a request of or giving a directive to Childname, be specific in describing what you want him/her to do. State important details. 
6. **Correction and Redirection:** State corrections and redirections in a positive, non-humiliating manner. State what you would like Childname to do rather than what you want him/her to stop doing (e.g., “Childname, we’re sitting at the kitchen table now”).  For both praise and reprimands, keep statements brief and specific to the behavior. 
7. **Calm Setting:** Processing situations that have led to emotional repercussions for Childname in a non-threatening setting and manner is important. Choose a situation where he/she is relaxed and therefore more receptive to objective analysis of what happened. This can help Childname gain better control while increasing awareness of his/her reactions. 
8. **Praise Positive Behaviors:**  Make all praise specific and legitimate. Clearly state the behavior to be reinforced and only praise behaviors that matter (e.g., “You told me that you were feeling frustrated, you explained why, and you stayed calm. That was very mature behavior.  Good job staying calm and explaining why you were frustrated”).  This technique will help make him/her aware of the behavior and encourage him/her to continue it and repeat it at a later time.  Establish a program of rewarding behaviors that are incompatible with the problem behavior. For example, if Childname tends to act out when frustrated by an assignment, set up a program in which he/she is rewarded each time he/she maintains control and asks for help. 

9. **Place Value on Strengths:** Place value on Childname’s strengths, such as mechanical, musical, or science abilities. Provide opportunities for Childname to demonstrate his/her ability to classmates and friends.

## Test taking anxiety 

### Test Taking Strategies 

***Test Taking Strategies***
The following anxiety reducing strategies are suggested:  
1. **Positive Self-Talk:** This is a strategy that can help Childname break the cycle of negative self- talk creating anxiety. It involves creating positive, yet realistic statements and repeating these statements to oneself in an anxiety-provoking situation. Some examples of positive self-talk are, “I can do this,” “I know this material” or “I’m intelligent” 
2. **Visualization:** There are two types of visualization that can be used to help combat test anxiety. The “Safe Place Method” requires Childname to conjure a mental image of a place, either real or imagined, that is both relaxing and safe. Specifically: Close your eyes, calm your breath, picture your safe place, look up and down and to the left and to the right of your safe place, take notice of what you see, smell, and feel and smile. A second visualization technique, called the “Olympic Method” is often used by athletes. This strategy requires that Childname imagine what he/she is trying to achieve. The steps are: close your eyes, calm your breath, picture yourself confidently taking the test, remember another test on which you did well, imagine yourself receiving a high test score or grade and smile. 
3. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** Anxiety has both a psychological and physiological component. Muscle tension is a common response to test anxiety that can be minimized by using progressive muscle relaxation. This method involves focusing on and then tensing and relaxing large muscle groups in a particular order. 
4. **Controlled Breathing:** Shallow, short breaths are an indicator of someone who is overwhelmed by anxiety. Practicing controlled breathing is a powerful way for Childname to deal with all types of anxiety. The method is: Sit comfortably. Place your hand on your stomach. Breathe gently in through your nose for a count of four. Let your breath expand your belly. Observe your stomach rising. Breathe out for a count of four. Observe your stomach flattening. Repeat. 

## Stress Reduction 

***Stress Reduction***

1. Safe Place: Identify a place both at home and at school where Childname feels safe and can regroup, calm down, or escape overwhelming situations such as a separate room, a counselor’s office, or a teacher’s or administrator’s office. Teach Childname to proactively use this strategy as needed when feeling overwhelmed. 
2. Utilize coping skills: Create a list of strategies (i.e., Coping Cards) with Childname for calming down when he/she is feeling upset, stressed, or overwhelmed. Make a list of things he/she can do when he/she is feeling this way, such as: 
    1. Take deep breaths.
    2. Count to 10.
    3. Repeat a positive message.
    4. Squeeze a ball.
    5. Ask for help.
    6. Ask to take a break. 
    7.  Go to a separate room. 
    8. Use a decision-making model. 
3. Journal: Have Childname write about his/her anxiety or thoughts, particularly before bedtime. He/She can make a list of concerns and how he/she might solve them. 
4. Relax: Encourage Childname to engage in relaxing and enjoyable hobbies. 
5. Stay in to relax: When stressed, people often feel the need to tackle everything at once, which can lead to burn out or failure. Instead, have Childname try some of these relaxation techniques. 
    1. Find Childname a simple routine task to complete at home.  Research shows that completing a repetitive task allows the brain to slow down and focus.  
    2. Childname can take a warm bath or hot shower to help boost his/her mood. Research shows that the sensation of warm water can trigger responses in the body and brain similar to those triggered by emotional warmth.  
    3. Have Childname try progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), especially before bed. Lying down, Childname will clench and release each muscle in his/her body for a few seconds, starting with your forehead and ending with your feet. Repeat as needed until his/her muscles feel relaxed. Audios for scripts or PMR can be found online for free (e.g., YouTube). 
6. Get out and be active: Make these activities even more relaxing for Childname by removing electronic devices (e.g., cell phones, tablets, computers). 
    1. Try yoga or meditation with Childname. The spiritual mantras used can help to focus the mind and help stave off feelings of anxiety.  
    2. Encourage Childname to exercise, such as going outside for a walk or light jog. Exercise helps to lessen anxiety and maintain feelings of calm even in the face of distressing events. His/Her body will also enjoy the natural light and fresh air. 
7. Engage in self-care: Self-care is any activity that we do deliberately in order to take care of our mental, emotional, and physical health. Good self-care is important to improve moods and reduce anxiety. 
    1. Have Childname enjoy a good laugh with friends, family, or a funny movie/book. Laughing creates feelings of happiness and euphoria. 
    2. Let Childname pick a snack, such as his/her favorite food. Certain foods have been shown to improve a person’s mood, such as dark chocolate. 
    3. Engage Childname’s senses. Light a scented candle in the home or have Childname try flavored tea. In particular, the smells of spearmint and lavender can help reduce feelings of Sleep stress. 

# ASD & IDD 

## Caregiver Resources for Autism 

***Caregiver Resources for Autism***
1. **Thinking About You Thinking About Me:**  2nd Edition, by Michelle Garcia Winner. For ages K-adulthood, the book provides the foundation for teaching students how to make social thinking work in their real lives and for using books like the Superflex Curriculum, You Are A Social Detective! and others. Understanding the perspectives of others is key to all interpersonal relationships. Many students, including those with high-functioning autism, Asperger’s syndrome, ADHD, and similar social and communication challenges, have difficulties understanding that other people have perspectives that are different from their own. Specific lessons, and how to apply them in different settings, are explored.  

2. **The Autism Society of New Jersey and National Autism Association-New York Metro** are agencies that provides families with a wealth of information and support about autism. Of particular interest might be the workshop for newly diagnosed families. More information can be found at their website, https://www.autismnj.org/ and https://nationalautismny.org/ 

3. **The Autism Society of North Carolina** has an online library and bookstore that is the largest non-profit, ASD-related bookstore in the United States.

8. **The Power of Neurodiversity**: Unleashing the Advantages of Your Differently Wired Brain by Armstrong, T. (2011) The author introduces a new understanding of neuropsychological disorders. He argues that if they are a part of the natural diversity of the human brain, they cannot simply be defined as illnesses.

***Personal Hygiene Resources***

1. **Personal Hygiene:** Personal hygiene is an important life skill that all young adults with autism must understand no matter what level of support is needed.  Skills such as bathing, using deodorant, brushing teeth, washing hands, and shampooing hair are all important skills that need to be taught for young adults with autism to become as independent as possible. 
    - *Taking Care of Myself* by Mary Wrobel provides a curriculum about healthy hygiene, puberty and personal care for young people with autism.  It includes easy-to-understand directions, as well as visuals for many of the topics that need to be addressed.  Teaching hygiene associated with private parts can serve as a good bridge to sex education.  
    - Teenagers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often visual learners. Also, they often learn best by doing rather than watching or listening. This means that tools like visual schedules, Social Stories with pictures, and video-modelling can be really good ways of helping them learn and use personal hygiene skills.

# Sensory Vulnerabilities 

## Sensory Regulation

***Sensory Regulation***
Children with sensory vulnerabilities such as Childname often benefit from regulation strategies. Please note that the information below includes a wide variety of sensory-based strategies that can be used across settings. While some of these strategies may not apply specifically to Childname, several of the included examples may be useful. It is recommended that Childname’s parents consult with an occupational therapist to determine the most appropriate types of sensory strategies based on his/her individual needs. 
1. **Self-Advocacy Training:** It is important to help kids with sensory vulnerabilities understand, ask for, and explain to others what they need to succeed. 
    1. **Assist with Boundary Setting:** Physical contact can be a stressor for kids with tactile sensitivity. Teach your child it is okay to set boundaries with friends and relatives. You can begin by modeling how to say it. For instance, “I’m not a big hugger, but I’m so glad to see you, Aunt Mabel!” 
    2. **Taking the Lead:** It’s tempting to wipe a smudge off your child’s face or brush the lint off his/her shirt. But if he/she is sensitive to touch, it may be better to point out what’s amiss and have him/her do it himself/herself. You may need to talk a younger child through fixing it. For instance, “You have some chocolate on your chin. The napkin didn’t clean it off. Why don’t you go use a wet washcloth to wipe it off?” 
    3. **Address Safety Issues:** If your child underreacts to touch, he/she may not recognize pain as you would expect. Point out events that are typically painful (a bumped head or minor burn). Explain that he/she should pay attention to them and tell an adult when they occur. Under-sensitive kids also need to be taught about situations they may not perceive as dangerous because they don’t “feel” them. That includes bitter cold weather and blazing heat. 
2. **School and Home-Based Strategies:** 
    1. Avoid bright lights and loud noises. 
    2. Use textures and weights to help kids feel comfortable. 
    3. Provide kids opportunities to get exercise like jumping, stomping, and bouncing on a ball. 
    4. **Classroom Accommodations: **Positive behavior intervention plans and informal supports like chewing gum or using a fidget can help at school. 
    5. Advance Warning: Give advance warning when you need to touch your child; make sure he/she sees you coming and that you tell him/her before you do anything. For example, try saying things like, “I need to wash your hair. I’m going to drizzle water on your head first.” 
    6. **Extra Blankets:** If your child has trouble sleeping at night, consider adding a few more blankets. The extra weight can provide the deep pressure some kids need for their bodies to be calmer. You can also purchase weighted blankets which provide the pressure without the added heat of extra covers. 
    7. **“Heavy Work”:** Allow your child to do the heavy work that allow him/her to use his/her muscles to push, pull, climb, carry or lift. This type of work can help kids keep calm and organize the body. Some chores like vacuuming and activities like riding a bike, pushing a shopping cart, or carrying groceries are examples of heavy work. 
    8. **Clothing:** Kids who are oversensitive to touch can struggle with the feel of certain fabrics. Consider letting your child wear layers and investing in clothes like zip-leg pants. When warmer weather comes around, he/she only has to get used to the feel of bare arms and legs. Also, consider allowing your child to wear the same outfit in many different colors to make up in comfort for what it might lack in style. 
    9. **Bathing:** For some hypersensitive kids, bath time struggles aren’t over getting clean, but over drying off. Your child’s towel may be too soft or too rough for his/her comfort. Consider taking him/her shopping to test out the feel of different types of towels and washcloths. He/She can choose ones that he/she is comfortable using. 
    10. **Sensory Bins & Toys:****
        - Some children with sensory vulnerabilities shy away from touching sticky, slimy or gooey things, while others gravitate towards it. Your child doesn’t have to avoid art projects. Stock up on large glue sticks or glue dots instead of squeeze glue. You can also invest in paint markers or sponge-tip squeeze bottles, instead of brush or finger paints. 
        - Sensory bins can help contain the mess while meeting your child’s sensory needs. Fill a small plastic bin with things like sand, rice, beans, shaving cream or water, and add small toys so that your child can play with them. 
        - Your child may also fiddle with objects. Give him/her sensory-friendly fidgets (such as a stress or Koosh ball, Silly Putty or rubber bands). He/She can carry a fidget in his/her pocket and won’t bother other people’s things.

# Sleep 

## Sleep Hygiene 

***Sleep Hygiene Resources***
The following healthy sleep habits are recommended: 
1. **Stick to a sleep schedule:** Childname should go to bed and get up at the same time every day, even on weekends, holidays, and days off. Being consistent reinforces the body's sleep-wake cycle and helps promote better sleep at night 
2. **Pay attention to food and drink before bed:** Childname should not go to bed either hungry or stuffed. Discomfort might keep him/her up. Also limit how much he/she drinks before bed, to prevent disruptive middle-of-the-night trips to the toilet. 
3. **Create a bedtime ritual:** Childname should try to do the same things each night to tell his/her body it is time to wind down. This might include taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book, or listening to soothing music — preferably with the lights dimmed. Relaxing activities can promote better sleep by easing the transition between wakefulness and drowsiness. Limit the use of TV or other electronic devices as part of the bedtime ritual. Screen time or other media use before bedtime may interfere with sleep. 
4. **Get comfortable:** Create an ideal room for sleeping. Often, this means cool, dark, and quiet. Consider using room-darkening shades, earplugs, a fan, or other devices to create an environment suitable for Childname’s needs.  
5. **Designate bed for sleeping only:**  Avoid activities other than sleeping, such as reading, doing homework, watching movies/TV, or playing games on a smartphone in bed. 
6. **Consultation with a pediatrician:** 
    1. If Childname has serious difficulty falling or staying asleep and incorporating healthy sleep habits is not working, consult with his/her pediatrician. Individuals can learn relaxation techniques, as well as thinking tools to help prepare for sleep. 
    2. If needed, medication options such as melatonin should be considered to assist in improving Childname’s sleeping habits. Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland in the brain that helps regulate one’s internal circadian rhythm, which helps control day/night cycles and normal sleeping patterns. Research has shown that the use of melatonin supplements can help treat sleep disturbances in individuals with ADHD. In particular, these studies show that melatonin can reduce sleep onset latency, which describes the amount of time required for a person to go from full wakefulness to sleep. 
    3. In addition, cognitive-behavioral treatments for insomnia such as Stimulus Control Procedures and Sleep Restriction Therapy can be helpful in improving overall sleep habits. These treatments address key behaviors under the control of the individual that, when modified, can help ameliorate sleep difficulties. Behaviors include bedtime/waketime, alcohol and drugs (caffeine, nicotine), sleeping environment (temperature, comfortable bed, noise), and exercise.

# WISC/WAIS Domain Specific Strategies 

## Working Memory 

***Working Memory Resources***
The following strategies and accommodations are suggested to provide support for working memory: 
1. **Switching Tasks:** Changing tasks more frequently can alleviate some of the drain on sustained working memory.  Changing from one task to the next sooner can help restore his/her focus for a brief period of time.  Tasks can be rotated, such that he/she might work for 10 minutes on math, 10 minutes on reading, and then return to another 10 minutes of math. 
2. **Verbalize:** Ask Childname to verbalize his/her steps in completing tasks he/she may struggle to complete. This can provide important information about where the breakdown is occurring and what supports are likely to work best.  
3. **Reduce Memory Load:** 
    1. Break tasks into smaller chunks. One task at a time is best, if possible. 
    2. Given the negative impact of competing information on working memory, it is important to reduce distractions in the environment that can tax or disrupt sustained working memory. 
    3. Reduce the amount of material Childname is expected to complete.  
    4. Keep new information brief and to the point, and repeat in a concise fashion.  
    5. Provide written directions for reference.  
    6. Simplify the amount of mental processing required by providing several oral “clues” for a problem and writing key words for each clue on the board. This way Childname does not have to hold all of the information in his/her mind at once.  
    7. Provide information in multiple ways: speak it, show it, and create opportunities to physically work with it or model it.  
4. **Repeat and Review:** 
    1. Be prepared to repeat information.  
    2. Provide opportunities to repeat the task.  
    3. Encourage practice to increase the amount of information encoded into memory.  
    4. Teach Childname to practice in short sessions, repeatedly throughout the day. Spaced practice is more effective than massed practice. Have him/her practice new skills or information in short sessions over the course of the day rather than in one long session. For example, give Childname a set of key facts to review for a few minutes two or three times during the school day, and encourage him/her to review again at home both at night and in the morning.  

## Fluid Reasoning 

***Fluid Reasoning Resources***
As fluid reasoning was an identified area of weakness for Childname, the following instructional approaches are recommended;  
1. Explain the concept of inductive reasoning to Childname. Guide him/her to examine several specific situations and formulate a general rule that applies for each case. Help him/her to develop an understanding of this concept by providing many situations in which to use it. Activities might include guided discovery, searching for patterns, and making comparisons and contrasts. 
2. When teaching Childname any new process or skill, provide slow, step-by-step instruction. Use manipulatives and concrete objects whenever possible to illustrate the concepts. 
3. When teaching problem-solving strategies, present problem situations in areas where Childname possesses expertise so that he/she can draw on his/her background knowledge as he/she learns the strategy. 
4. Provide Childname with practice in using problem-solving strategies that can be generalized to a variety of situations. Include the following steps: deciding what the problem is and what you would like the outcome to be; brainstorming possible solutions; considering which solutions are feasible; considering the positive and negative outcomes of each of the solutions; choosing the solution that seems best; trying it; asking if it is working; modifying it or selecting a different solution if the strategy does not work, and generalizing the use of the strategy so that it is self-initiated in multiple situations. 
5. Teach Childname how to analyze tasks into their component steps and then to sequence the steps. Directly teach generalization to a variety of tasks such as writing a research paper or planning a trip. 
6. Integrate higher-level thinking skills into daily lessons. Two good resource for activities that foster self-directed thinking are Catch Them Thinking: A Handbook of Classroom Strategies (Bellanca & Fogarty, 1986), Creating the Thoughtful Classroom: Strategies to Promote Student Thinking (Udall & Daniels, 1991) and A Comprehensive Approach to Teaching Thinking (Schiever, 1991). These books present strategies that may be used to teach thinking skills in all classes. 

## Processing Speed 

***Processing Speed Resources***
Efforts to improve an individual’s processing speed have not been shown to be effective. While skills in academic content areas such as reading, math and writing can be better automatized, improving speed of performance, remediation of cognitive processing speed deficits is not considered viable. Thus, Childname will likely always tend toward slower processing. He/She will likely always need to allow extra time when performing most tasks. However, in general, the greater Childname’s automaticity with decoding, handwriting and/or typing, math facts and procedures, the greater his/her speeded approach will be. Thus, he/she should increase his/her efforts to hone his/her skills in order to improve his/her rate of processing and production. As he/she grows to keep better pace with his/her classmates, his/her frustration with learning, himself/herself, and task demands should decrease, and his/her school pleasure should increase. 
1. Due to Childname’s slower processing speed, he/she tends to take longer to accomplish tasks than others. Thus, when possible, his/her teachers should consider giving him/her extra time to complete long assignments and/or should consider giving him/her shortened assignments. For instance, where ten practice problems of a single variety to be given in mathematics, Childname could be responsible for five. 
2. Childname is strongly encouraged to experiment with varying the pace with which he/she accomplishes tasks and practice being less cautious. Thus, prior to starting an activity, he/she should take stock and consider whether a slow, deliberate approach is required, whether a speeded approach is warranted, or something in between. He/she should then evaluate the results and reflect on the accuracy of his/her initial assessment of the assignment and the efficacy of his/her chosen approach. 
3. Childname should sometimes work without an eraser. Furthermore, his/her teachers should encourage legible handwriting but not Childname’s tendency toward meticulous handwriting. 
4. Childname will benefit from being given estimates of how long assignments should take or being told how long he/she should work on a given assignment. He/she may then find it useful to use a visual timer that visually depicts time passing (a red tab is pulled down and around, covering the space of one minute to one hour; www.addwarehouse.com), allowing him/her to see time passing spatially as well as numerically. He/she can also use online “timer” websites such as www.online-stopwatch.com. 
5. Childname should be encouraged to hand in work after an agreed upon time or after an agreed upon amount of re-checking has taken place. 
6. Adults working with Childname must avoid reinforcing perfectionism by praising it. Instead, adults should reinforce effort and accept non-critical imperfections in Childname’s work. 

## Visual-Spatial Processing 

***Visual-Spatial Processing Resrouces***
Visual spatial ability involves skills such as understanding things by looking at them and picturing how details fit together to create a bigger picture. These skills are important to academic success because they may help the child understand how individual parts are related to complex 'whole'. They may also assist in the acquisition of early reading skills. The following are examples of supports which can be provided to Childname to address visual spatial deficits: 
1. In planning instruction for the student, consider how his/her difficulty with spatial organization and his/her inattention to visual details will affect performance. Think of ways to modify assignments and tasks so that the student can be successful. 
2. Ensure that the student clears his/her desk completely before they begin any task. He/She should remove all extraneous materials from his/her desk. Attempt to reduce visual clutter from the area of the classroom in which he/she works. 
3. As far as possible, explain new skills and concepts to the student orally. 
4. Recognize that manipulatives, drawings, diagrams, and charts may overwhelm and confuse the student. Reduce the number of visual displays and instead provide clear verbal descriptions. 
5. The student will have trouble interpreting and gaining meaningful information from visual displays, such as models, graphs, maps, diagrams, charts. Instead, emphasize sequential verbal approaches and provide explicit outlines and study guides to help to structure the student’s learning. 
6. The student is likely to have trouble copying material from chalkboards or textbooks and completing tasks that involve aligning information, such as writing basic math problems. Provide the student with a copy of notes from the board, as well as textbooks that he/she can write in. 
7. Provide the student with extra visual structure on worksheets and assignments. For example, arrange problems in numbered boxes or columns. 
8. Do not penalize the student for placing information incorrectly on a page. Instead, provide graph paper and lined paper that will help the student organize his/her work. 
9. Use colored highlighting to indicate the order in which the student is to work on the sections. Choose a different color for each step and use them consistently. 

# Additional Learning Strategies 

## Study skills- adolescents 

***Learning and Study Skills*** 
Childname would likely benefit from developing effective learning skills, including (a) what to study, (b) how to study and (c) how to test.  
1. **What to Study:** When informed of an exam, Childname would benefit from directly asking the course instructor what material he/she should focus on for the test, including content and question types.  
2. **How to Study:** Effective study materials and schedules need to be based on a combination of an individual’s cognitive, neurocognitive and learning profiles, the content of the to be tested material and the format of the anticipated test. Childname needs to learn how to create effective study materials and aides that will support his/her learning style and compliment the material and test format. Once he/she has created a study guide, he/she will need to follow a specific and tangible study schedule to prepare for an exam. When studying, Childname will need to place himself in a setting that is free from distractions. Studying is often most productive when an individual conducts a pre-task evaluation, reviews unknown and known material, and re-tests himself.    
3. **How to Test:** Earning good grades is not only based on successfully studying the appropriate content; it also requires that the test-taker be efficient and effective when taking the exam. To support the development of Childname’s how to test skills, he/she will also benefit from learning the strategies outlined below.  
    1. **Memory Dump/Download:** When examinees sit down for an exam, they will increase the probability of doing well if they write out all of the information that they know for the exam on a blank piece of paper and use those notes as they take the test. This strategy builds confidence, decreases test anxiety and primes the recall of information that is not immediately remembered.  
    2. **Work on Easier Items First:** When examinees sit down for an exam, they will lose confidence if they dwell on an initial question that is difficult. Instead they will build confidence if they complete every item that they perceive as easy. Further, they may be better able to complete more difficult items once they tangibly see how much they know.  
    3. **Budgeting Time:** Effective examinees need to appropriately allocate their time when taking an exam. For example, if all of the items are worth the same amount of points, there is no reason to spend an excessive amount of item on a single difficult item. Instead of fighting with a single difficult question, the majority of the time should be spent earning points on the manageable items.  
    4. **Highlight Essential Aspects of the Directions:** Effective test taking requires that examinees know what they need to accomplish and what they are being asked. Thus, it is critical to highlight/circle/underline essential information in the instructions. For example, it is imperative to highlight/circle/underline trigger words and phrases, such as: not, all of the above, least, best. In addition, it is important to highlight/circle/underline instructions about the test requirements, including “Answer 3 of the 5 questions.”     
    5. **Different Strategies for Different Questions:** Different question types require unique strategies and amounts of time. Not all test takers are innately aware of this. As a result, this is a skill that needs to be tangibly taught to students. For example, using a pre-test for an upcoming test, it would beneficial to describe the required strategy for each item and have Childname use the item strategy and answer the question.   
4. **Studying:** two helpful online resources are:  
    1. **Test Taking Tips** provides a multitude of strategies for students who need support with their note taking, studying, and test-taking habits. The address is: www.testtakingtips.com 
    2. **How to Study** provides a wealth of support for students, including information, resources, strategies and supports for effective learning and studying, managing test anxiety, and organizing materials, schedules, and goals. The address is: www.howtostudy.com   

## Increasing Academic Motivation 

***Increasing Academic Motivation***
The following strategies can help increase academic motivation: 
1. Engage Childname in setting his/her own learning goals. Make sure that these goals are challenging, but achievable.  
2. Encourage Childname to take ownership for his/her learning. Provide opportunities for Childname to reflect on what he/she has learned and accomplished. 
3. Make real-world connections to help Childname see how the skills he/she is learning can be applied to the real world.  
4. Use technologies for learning, such as smart phones, that Childname may already be choosing to use outside of class.  
5. Remind Childname that success often requires persistence and a willingness to overcome obstacles.  
6. Give prompt feedback and praise good work to help build Childname’s self-confidence.  
7. Classroom climate is important. If Childname experiences the classroom as a caring, supportive place where there is a sense of belonging and everyone is valued and respected, he/she might tend to participate more fully in the process of learning. 
8. **Self-Advocacy:** Ensure that Childname understands his/her learning needs and is fully aware of his/her strengths. Have him/her practice presenting his/her strengths and needs to reinforce these efforts. Find role models who have struggled with similar learning and attentional challenges. Expose Childname to their stories that detail how they have compensated for their difficulties and overcome challenges. Also, encourage Childname to ask for support from teachers and other school personnel when needed. He/she can learn to request things from his/her teachers by saying “I learn best when…” or “It helps me if I….” As Childname effectively communicates his/her needs to others, provide ample praise for this behavior.
