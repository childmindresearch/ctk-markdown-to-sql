## DSM-5 DIAGNOSIS

315.00 (F81.0) Specific Learning Disorder, With impairment in reading 

## Academics and Learning

1. **School Consultation:** It is recommended that a school consultation is requested in {{CHILD-NAME}}’s school in order to share the results of this evaluation. It is important that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s teachers understand his/her learning profile and that he/she receive educational services and supports to target difficulties in a formalized support plan (i.e., IEP).  
2. **Educational Placement:** {{!REC-CLASS-PLACEMENT}}
3. **Classroom Modifications and Accommodations:** {{CHILD-NAME}} should be provided with the following classroom modifications and accommodations, in order to ensure {{CHILD-NAME}} grasps presented material and can demonstrate his/her knowledge:
    1. *Check for Understanding:* Individuals working with {{CHILD-NAME}} should utilize methods to ensure that {{CHILD-NAME}} understands information. For example, {{CHILD-NAME}} may be asked to repeat directions prior to task initiation. Socratic questioning, and guided exploration techniques can also be used to ensure that {{CHILD-NAME}} comprehends the concept being taught. 
    2. *Preferential Seating:* {{CHILD-NAME}} requires preferential seating where both auditory and visual stimuli are optimally received, as well as away from distracting peers. This will facilitate his/her ability to attend to and understand material. (Note that preferential seating does not necessarily mean the front of the classroom, but where {{CHILD-NAME}} can best access instruction with minimal distraction.)
    3. *Class Notes:*  {{CHILD-NAME}} requires access to teacher notes/outlines and printed copies of instructions or directions, whenever possible. 
    4. *Additional Time in Class:* Professionals working with {{CHILD-NAME}} should provide him/her with additional “wait” time to respond and should encourage him/her to elaborate when answering questions in order to accurately determine his/her knowledge of a topic. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s teachers should also consider the need for extended time to complete assignments when necessary. 
    5. *Modified Homework Assignments:* Reducing the amount of work in each area assigned for homework should be considered in consultation between parents and teachers so that {{CHILD-NAME}} can complete his/her assignment(s) in approximately the same amount of time other students are expected to spend. Examples of modified assignments are: having an abbreviated spelling list and writing a half-page report instead of a whole page, but still including all necessary pieces of the assignment. Try not to send unfinished class work home for homework.  
    6. *Tasks Broken Down:* Tasks should be broken down into more manageable units in order for {{CHILD-NAME}} to not become overwhelmed with the amount of work presented and to better organize his/her work. {{CHILD-NAME}} should be provided with interim due dates so his/her teacher(s) can check on the progress before the due date.
    7. *Use of Assistive Technology:* {{CHILD-NAME}} should be provided an opportunity to use text-to-speech (e.g., google read and write) or audiobooks in order to help with reading comprehension. Suggested potential resources appear below. 
    8. *Learning Methods:* As the rigor of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s educational environment increases, {{CHILD-NAME}} may benefit from visual learning methods, including graphic organizers, outlines, and diagrams. Several software programs are available to help students implement these strategies. For example, software and programs available at www.inspiration.com/visual-learning provide visual tools to help students learn and succeed. Also, {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrated a strength in verbal reasoning and listening comprehension. As the rigor of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s educational environment increases, {{CHILD-NAME}} may benefit from auditory teaching methods and assignments relying heavily on oral language skills.
4. **Academic Support:** {{CHILD-NAME}}’s instructional needs must be addressed immediately to ensure that he/she does not quit trying and that he/she progresses academically. Due to {{CHILD-NAME}}’s significant learning weaknesses, he/she continues to require(s) special education intervention from a learning specialist trained in research-based practices to remediate his/her deficits in decoding/reading fluency/reading comprehension/phonological processing/encoding/etc. Instruction should be individualized and/or in small groups and provided to {{CHILD-NAME}} daily. Examples of evidence-based programs are listed below: 
    1. *Orton-Gillingham method*, which is a multi-modal, research-based reading remediation program that targets reading instruction through visual (learning graphic symbols), auditory (discriminating among sounds), and kinesthetic (learning motor patterns for writing symbols) modalities. 
    2. *Wilson Reading System- 4th Edition* (https://www.wilsonlanguage.com/programs/wilson-reading-system/4th-edition/) is a multi-modal, Orton-Gillingham-based approach to reading.  The program addresses balanced literacy: sight-word reading, decoding, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension. 
    3. *The Lindamood Bell Seeing Stars® program* (https://lindamoodbell.com/program/seeing-stars-program) is a multi-modal, Orton-Gillingham-based approach to reading and writing intervention that encompasses these three modalities. This program focuses on word attack, word recognition, spelling, and paragraph reading by improving symbol imagery skills and increasing dual-coding ability (the integration of imagery and language). Initially, students learn the lip, tone, and mouth actions required to produce certain sounds. After students learn these skills, activities focus on sequencing, reading, and spelling the oral aspects of sounds to identify and order sounds in words. Direct instruction in letter patterns, sight words, and using context cues in reading is provided.  
    4. *Preventing Academic Failure (PAF)* (www.pafprogram.com), a multisensory curriculum, is an Orton-Gillingham based program for teaching reading, spelling, and handwriting in the elementary grades. One of the key features of PAF is its multisensory approach that draws upon three modalities in learning to read: visual (learning graphic symbols), auditory (discriminating among sounds) and kinesthetic (learning motor patterns for writing symbols). This integrated approach utilizes explicit phonics instruction and helps students associate phonemes, graphic symbols, and the motor patterns for writing these symbols. To further reinforce these multisensory associations, teachers demonstrate how reading and spelling work as reciprocal processes.  
    5. *Lindamood Bell The Visualizing and Verbalizing® (V/V®) program* develops concept imagery—the ability to create an imagined or imaged gestalt from language—as a basis for comprehension and higher order thinking. The development of concept imagery improves reading and listening comprehension, memory, oral vocabulary, critical thinking, and writing. 
    6. *Spelling Mastery:* Because {{CHILD-NAME}} demonstrates weak spelling skills, consider programs such as Spelling Mastery, (https://www.mheducation.com/prek-12/explore/direct-instruction/products.html), which includes phonemic, morphemic, and whole-word strategies. The program reviews the relationships between spoken sounds and written letters when applying them to spelling. This program consists of explicit instruction, careful selection of spelling words, and repeated and cumulative practice to help students master each concept.  
    7. *Spell-Links:* Through a biological brain-based oral language model, Spell-Links utilizes a speech-to-print word study approach that teaches students to read and spell by learning to attend to the sound structure of spoken words, then connect and combine sounds (phonology), recognize letter patterns (orthography), and understand meaning (semantics and morphology). In addition, Spell-Links aims to concurrently develop student’s reading, spelling, and written expression skills by increasing their meta-linguistic capacities and developing executive function to effectively apply word knowledge, skills, and strategies.

5. **Testing Accommodations:** {{CHILD-NAME}} requires the following accommodations during tests due to deficits related to reading in order to accurately represent his/her knowledge:   
    1. Extended time (1.5x/2x) 
    2. Tests Read 
    3. Use of assistive technology (i.e., text-to-speech) when required to read 
    4. Questions and directions repeated 
    5. Flexible Setting/Separate location to minimize distractions  
    6. Breaks during testing (i.e., 5-minute break every 20 minutes) 
    7. Multiple day administration, if necessary 
    8. Reduced number of test items per page
    9. Use of masks or markers to maintain place
    10. On-task focusing prompts provided
    11. Answers recorded in test booklet

Socratic questioning, and guided exploration techniques can also be used to ensure that {{CHILD-NAME}} comprehends the concept being taught. 
    2. *Refocusing and Redirection:* Verbal and visual prompts are needed in order for {{CHILD-NAME}} to remain on task and improve comprehension and listening (i.e., a visual to indicate important information is coming next to encourage attention). 
    3. *Preferential Seating:* {{CHILD-NAME}} requires preferential seating where both auditory and visual stimuli are optimally received, as well as away from distracting peers. This will facilitate his/her ability to attend to and understand material.  (Note that preferential seating does not necessarily mean the front of the classroom, but where {{CHILD-NAME}} can best access instruction with minimal distraction.) 
    4. *Class Notes:*  {{CHILD-NAME}} requires access to teacher notes/outlines and printed copies of instructions or directions, whenever possible. 
    5. *Additional Time in Class:* Professionals working with {{CHILD-NAME}} should provide him/her with additional “wait” time to respond and should encourage him/her to elaborate when answering questions in order to accurately determine his/her knowledge of a topic. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s teachers should also consider the need for extended time to complete assignments when necessary. 
    6. *Modified Homework Assignments:* Reducing the amount of work in each area assigned for homework should be considered in consultation between parents and teachers so that {{CHILD-NAME}} can complete his/her assignment(s) in approximately the same amount of time other students are expected to spend. Examples of modified assignments are: solving the odd-numbered math problems instead of all the items and writing a half-page report instead of a whole page, but still including all necessary pieces of the assignment. Try not to send unfinished class work home for homework.  
    7. *Tasks Broken Down:* Tasks should be broken down into more manageable units in order for {{CHILD-NAME}} to not become overwhelmed with the amount of work presented and to better organize his/her work. {{CHILD-NAME}} should be provided with interim due dates so his/her teacher(s) can check on the progress before the due date. 
    8. *Use of a Graphic Organizer:* As writing is a complex task that requires a great deal of mental organization, {{CHILD-NAME}} should be provided with a graphic organizer during writing tasks in order to help him/her better organize his/her thoughts into a coherent writing piece.  
5. **Functional Behavior Assessment and Behavior Intervention Plan:** A Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA) should be conducted and, if deemed appropriate, subsequent Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP) put into place to address {{CHILD-NAME}}’s behavior in school that is intrusive to his/her learning and the learning of others. The plan, if appropriate, should be specific and clearly stated, including the people responsible for implementing interventions, rewards, and measures of progress. Implementation of an individualized behavior plan as well as consistent behavioral services and classroom interventions will be critical to ensure that he/she can maximally benefit from intellectually challenging material and promote his/her motivation to engage in the academic setting.

## DSM-5 DIAGNOSIS
315.32 (F80.2)		Language Disorder  

## Further Evaluation

**Speech and Language Evaluation and Services:** In light of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s inconsistent performance in language screening, a comprehensive evaluation of his/her language processing is recommended. This assessment should be performed by a certified speech-language pathologist. It is critical that this thorough evaluation aim to identify {{CHILD-NAME}}’s complete speech and language profile, including his/her pragmatic language skills. It is recommended that he/she be provided with additional services through an Individualized Education Program (IEP) if warranted. 

## Academics and Learning

1. **School Consultation:** It is recommended that a school consultation is requested in {{CHILD-NAME}}’s school in order to share the results of this evaluation. It is important that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s teachers understand his/her learning profile and that he/she continues to receive educational services and supports in his/her school environment to target executive functioning difficulties in a formalized support plan (i.e., IEP, Section 504 Plan).  
2. **Educational Placement:** {{!REC-CLASS-PLACEMENT}}
3. **Classroom Modifications and Accommodations:** Due to language weaknesses, {{CHILD-NAME}} should be provided with the following classroom modifications and accommodations, in order to ensure that he/she grasps presented material and can demonstrate his/her knowledge: 
    1. *Teach Active Listening:* {{CHILD-NAME}} can learn how to actively listen, such as stopping what he/she is doing at the time, focus his/her attention, ask questions, restate the information or question, or take notes. 
    2. *Comprehension Checking:* Have {{CHILD-NAME}} repeat or paraphrase what he/she has heard or understood in order to check for accuracy and to provide an opportunity for rehearsal.  Ultimately, teaching self-initiated “comprehension checking” strategies (e.g., the child asking for repetition of instructions) helps to promote independent management of working memory weaknesses. 
    3. *Collaborative Approach with Speech-Language Therapist:* Use a collaborative approach for teaching language and academic skills. In this model, the speech-language pathologist (SLP) shares with the teacher the current focus of therapy and ways to integrate work toward the language objectives into classroom activities. The teacher shares the current units or skills being presented in class. Together, they can decide on modifications, instructional techniques, or presentation style that can be instituted in class and content-related vocabulary and concepts for the SLP to integrate into therapy activities. 
    4. *Presentation Style:*
        - Ensure that you have {{CHILD-NAME}}’s attention before speaking to him/her. If you are giving a series of oral directions, limit them to two or three steps, and ask him/her to repeat them.
        - Limit the length and complexity of all instructions to {{CHILD-NAME}} and state them in the order he/she is to do them.
        - Frequent repetition of instructions will be critical for {{CHILD-NAME}}’s instruction.
        - Make oral instructions clear and concise. Simplify complex instructions and avoid multiple commands.
    5. *Multisensory/Multimodal Supports:* {{CHILD-NAME}} will always do best when information is conveyed through multiple sensory modalities. When possible, use visual supports, schedules, and cues paired with verbal instructions, which can help with comprehension and engagement. Present all types of verbal information accompanied by visual stimuli that clearly illustrate the concept being taught. Examples are pictures, charts, graphs, semantic maps, and videotapes. 
    6. *Ask for Repetition:* Directly teach {{CHILD-NAME}} to request repetition or rephrasing of instructions, when necessary. Additionally, encourage {{CHILD-NAME}} to ask you to paraphrase test questions when needed. He/she may know the content but not understand the question.
    7. *Key Points on Board:* Prior to beginning a lecture, write on the board the important points to be covered and review the major points at the end of the lecture. This will help {{CHILD-NAME}} recognize and retain the critical information.
    8. *Provide an Outline:* Provide {{CHILD-NAME}} with an outline of questions to follow during a lecture. Go over the questions before beginning the lecture and guide a discussion of the answers after the lecture.
    9. *Additional Time in Class:* Professionals working with {{CHILD-NAME}} should provide him/her with additional response time and should encourage and support him/her in elaborating answers to questions in order to accurately determine his/her knowledge of a topic.
    10. *Language-Infused Curriculum:* Teachers should be experienced in working with children with specialized learning needs and using a curriculum that is infused with specific instruction in pragmatic language support throughout the school day.

1. **Assistive Technology:** Due to {{CHILD-NAME}}’s noted academic/ fine motor weaknesses, impacting his/her ability to independently access the general education curriculum, it is recommended he/she receive an Assistive Technology Evaluation in order to determine whether the use of assistive technology within the school setting is an appropriate and necessary support for him/her at this time. According to the most recent research, assistive technology is an effective support for students within the classroom and larger school settings for students with a myriad of weaknesses that impact their school functioning and ability to independently access curriculum. The appropriate assistive devices may help {{CHILD-NAME}} work more quickly and accurately, increase his/her confidence and independence, and help him/her meet his/her educational goals.
2. **Supplemental Writing Evaluation:** The current evaluation did not comprehensively assess {{CHILD-NAME}}’s writing skills. Due to reported concerns regarding his/her written expression, further evaluation is recommended to assess his/her handwriting fluency, spelling, compositional fluency, writing mechanics, and composition: both narrative and expository. It is recommended that he/she be provided with additional services through an Individualized Education Program (IEP) if warranted.  

## Academics and Learning

1. **Academic Support:** Due to {{CHILD-NAME}}’s significant learning weaknesses, he/she continues to require special education intervention from a learning specialist trained in research-based practices to remediate his/her deficits in writing. Instruction should be individualized and/or in small groups and provided to {{CHILD-NAME}} daily.  An example of an evidence-based program is as follows:
    - *Step Up To Writing* teaches students to organize ideas and information, write topic sentences and thesis statements, connect key ideas with supportive details, write conclusions, think creatively and other components of effective writing.  The program is divided into manageable steps and includes writing examples, activity sheets, and scoring rubrics, skills sequences for strategies and topics for writing projects.  https://www.voyagersopris.com/literacy/step-up-to-writing/overview 

## Assistive Technology

Students who struggle with either the fine motor skill of writing or with the content and organization of written expression benefit significantly from the use of assistive technology, including:
1. **Word Processing Tools**, including a basic keyboard and word processing software (such as Microsoft Word or Pages) are of particular benefit to users who struggle with the task of writing. Individuals can improve keyboarding skills with software programs and websites geared toward their developmental level and interests such as Typing Instructor and Typing Instructor for Kids, Mavis Beacon Keyboarding Kidz, and All The Right Type. 
2. **Apps:** Low Cost or free apps are available for download on tablets and smartphones:  
    1. *Notability* is a word processing app that allows for a combination of typing, handwriting with a stylus or finger, use of photos, and audio recordings within a single note. It also offers streamlined organization in which users can organizes notes into different folders (i.e., Math, Social Studies, Writer’s Workshop) to keep all of their notes in one convenient location. Cost: $9.99 
    2. *SnapType Pro* allows the user to take a photo of a worksheet and upload it to the app and type onto the worksheet rather than writing answers onto the paper. Cost: $4.99 
    3. *Dragon Anywhere* is a professional-grade dictation software that captures what a user says and creates text within its own platform. In addition to recording speech, the tool also utilizes voice commands to edit text (i.e., “Undo” or “Select first sentence”) and change formatting (i.e., bold, capitalization, punctuation). The app is equipped with an on-screen keyboard and dictionary. Once a document is finished, it can be shared as a Word Document, PDF, or in the body of an email. Dictation apps are particularly useful for students who struggle with the multi-step process of writing (thought production, organization, physically writing the words) and lose their thoughts before they are able to write them down. Price: 1 week free trial then $15/month 
    4. *Co:Writer* is a writing tool that aids with phonetic/inventive spelling, grammar, and topic-related vocabulary by using grammar- and vocabulary-smart word prediction, translation support, and speech recognition to help struggling spellers not get stuck while writing. As users type, Co:Writer offers words or phrases they are likely attempting to write, even if grammar and spelling are off. The user then can select the word or phrase they want from the drop-down list and continue writing without losing time and frustration to attempting to spell out challenging words. Cost: $4.99/month
    5. *Kurzweil 3000:* is a comprehensive educational software which includes text-to-speech with natural voices, the ability to read text from different media (e.g., word, PDF, and websites), access to traditional dictionaries and picture/talking dictionaries, and helps create study guides.  Additional features assist in writing by providing access to graphic organizers, word prediction, word lists, spell check, and speech-to-text.  Features also assist in math by providing a talking calculator.	 

# IDD 

## Academics and Learning

1. **School Consultation:** It is recommended that a school consultation is requested in {{CHILD-NAME}}’s school in order to share the results of this evaluation. It is important that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s teachers understand his/her learning profile and that he/she continues to receive educational services and supports in his/her school environment to target executive functioning difficulties in a formalized support plan (i.e., IEP, Section 504 Plan).
2. **Educational Placement:** {{CHILD-NAME}} requires placement in a small (i.e., low student-to-teacher ratio), nurturing classroom setting within a small special education school with special-education teachers and professionals who are specifically trained to teach children with a similar cognitive profile and can address each child’s specific social, language, and academic needs. Children with intellectual disabilities require a modified skills-based curriculum that can provide intense language remediation and training that allow them to make progress and appropriately demonstrate their intellectual potential. Each child’s strengths should be reinforced throughout the curriculum. Students should be surrounded by peers with similar cognitive abilities and learning needs, as well as good peer models without behavioral problems. Classes should also be taught by educators who will be patient and supportive of their students’ learning styles, as well as recognize their strengths and weaknesses. Children with intellectual disabilities require multisensory support and interventions and small group instruction, as well as one-on-one instruction as needed. The curriculum should include direct instruction on adaptive daily living skills.  Such a school should offer the required support to help each child develop his/her talents and work towards greater independence and adaptive functioning. 

# Gifted 

## Academics and Learning

**Gifted Education:** {{CHILD-NAME}}’s profile aligns with that of a “gifted learner,” and he/she would benefit from being provided with learning opportunities that are commensurate with his/her intellectual potential. The current understanding of gifted students is that they have an advanced knowledge-base and unique areas of learning need compared to their non-gifted peers.  Thus, {{CHILD-NAME}} also needs to be monitored to ensure that his/her learning and emotional needs are being effectively addressed. Specifically, when gifted students are not provided with challenging academic demands, they are at risk of becoming accustomed to a relaxed approach to learning. Subsequently, this can lead to underachievement, particularly as the curriculum develops becomes more complex and abstract, and independent-learner demands are increased. Further, when a learner, such as {{CHILD-NAME}}, is not presented with content that is commensurate with his/her intellectual potential, he/she can become frustrated, experience decreased self-esteem, and struggle with lower internal motivation. In the event this occurs, he/she may engage in problematic behaviors as an outlet for his/her frustration.  
In addition, gifted learners often experience testing anxiety and are at increased risk of developing issues associated with perfectionism. Thus, if {{CHILD-NAME}} struggles with either of these or other similar difficulties, it will be imperative to support his/her ability to implement adaptive coping strategies, including but not limited to the development of effective learning and study skills.   
Overwhelmingly, learners, particularly those who are gifted, benefit from participation in preferred structured activities. Thus, it is strongly recommended that {{CHILD-NAME}} continue to participate in preferred extra-curricular activities of his/her choice. He/she will benefit from having the opportunity to participate in a non-academic activity that supports the development of his/her socialization skills, improves his/her understanding of teamwork, and allows him/her to excel in an area of interest.  

# Anxiety (School-based) 

## Academics and Learning

1. **School Consultation:** It is recommended that a consultation is requested in {{CHILD-NAME}}’s school in order to share the results of this evaluation. It is important that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s teachers understand his/her learning profile and that he/she receives services and supports in the school environment to target emotional difficulties. 
2. **School Counseling:** {{CHILD-NAME}} may benefit from school-based counseling services, on an individual basis. Topics to be addressed should include improving stress tolerance and developing concrete and easily accessible coping strategies. They can also be taught, and subsequently be encouraged to practice, the following activities: deep breathing, mindfulness activities, deep pressure (hand massaging, joint compression), tactile activities (squeezing a ball). Other sensory experiences that may be soothing to {{CHILD-NAME}} may be explored. 
3. **School Accommodations:** {{CHILD-NAME}} would benefit from accommodations to reduce anxiety in the school setting. His/Her class schedule should be reviewed to determine if he/she is placed in appropriate classes. Other accommodations should be considered to minimize situations that could contribute to feelings of anxiety (e.g., reducing time in busy hallways). To the extent possible and appropriate, {{CHILD-NAME}} should be involved in the development of these accommodations. 

# Hearing Impaired Accommodations 

1. **Testing Accommodations:** {{CHILD-NAME}} requires the following accommodations during tests due to hearing loss and his/her academic and executive skills deficits associated with hearing loss in order to accurately represent his/her knowledge:
    1. Extended time (1.5x) 
    2. Questions and directions repeated 
    3. Flexible Setting/Separate location to minimize distractions and background noise 
    4. Breaks during testing (e.g., 5-minute break every 20 minutes) 
    5. Multiple day administration, if necessary 
    6. Orally presented instructions or questions should also be presented in written form whenever appropriate 
2. **Classroom Modifications and Accommodations:** Due to language weaknesses, {{CHILD-NAME}} should be provided with the following classroom modifications and accommodations, in order to ensure that he/she grasps presented material and can demonstrate his/her knowledge:
    1. Teach Active Listening: {{CHILD-NAME}} can learn how to actively listen, such as stopping what he/she is doing at the time, focus his/her attention, ask questions, restate the information or question, or take notes. 
        - Comprehension Checking: Have {{CHILD-NAME}} repeat or paraphrase what he/she has heard or understood in order to check for accuracy and to provide an opportunity for rehearsal.  Ultimately, teaching self-initiated “comprehension checking” strategies (e.g., the child asking for repetition of instructions) helps to promote independent management of working memory weaknesses. 
    2. Collaborative Approach with Speech-Language Therapist and Teacher of the Deaf: Use a collaborative approach for teaching language and academic skills. In this model, the speech-language pathologist (SLP) and Teacher of the Deaf share with the teacher the current focus of therapy and ways to integrate work toward the language objectives into classroom activities. The teacher shares the current units or skills being presented in class. Together, they can decide on modifications, instructional techniques, or presentation style that can be instituted in class and content-related vocabulary and concepts for the SLP to integrate into therapy activities. 
    3. Presentation Style:
        - Ensure that you have {{CHILD-NAME}}’s attention before speaking to him/her. If you are giving a series of oral directions, limit them to two or three steps, and ask him/her to repeat them.  
        - Limit the length and complexity of all instructions to {{CHILD-NAME}} 
        - Frequent repetition of instructions will be critical for {{CHILD-NAME}}’s instruction.  
        - Make oral instructions clear and concise, and provide them in written form as well whenever possible. 
    4. Multisensory/Multimodal Supports: {{CHILD-NAME}} will always do best when information is conveyed through multiple sensory modalities. When possible, use visual supports, schedules, and cues paired with verbal instructions. Present all types of verbal information accompanied by visual stimuli that clearly illustrate the concept being taught. Examples are pictures, charts, graphs, semantic maps, and videotapes. {{CHILD-NAME}} should also be presented with visual or written copies of all new information or instructions presented verbally. This should be provided in advance whenever possible.
    5. Ask for Repetition: Directly teach {{CHILD-NAME}} to request repetition or rephrasing of instructions, when necessary. Additionally, encourage {{CHILD-NAME}} to ask you to paraphrase test questions when needed. He/she may know the content but not understand the question.
    6. Key Points on Board: Prior to beginning a lecture, write on the board the important points to be covered and review the major points at the end of the lecture. This will help {{CHILD-NAME}} recognize and retain the critical information.
    7. Provide an Outline: Provide {{CHILD-NAME}} with an outline of questions to follow during a lecture. Go over the questions before beginning the lecture and guide a discussion of the answers after the lecture. 
    8. Additional Time in Class: Professionals working with {{CHILD-NAME}} should provide him/her with additional response time and should encourage and support him/her in elaborating answers to questions in order to accurately determine his/her knowledge of a topic.
    9. Class Notes:  {{CHILD-NAME}} requires access to teacher notes/outlines and printed copies of instructions or directions, whenever possible.
    10. Preferential Seating: {{CHILD-NAME}} requires preferential seating where both auditory and visual stimuli are optimally received, as well as away from distracting peers. This will facilitate her ability to hear, attend to, and understand material. When possible, arranging seats in a U-shape can allow {{CHILD-NAME}} to interact more with peers. (Note that preferential seating does not necessarily mean the front of the classroom, but where {{CHILD-NAME}} can best access instruction.)
    11. Minimize Background Noise: Background noise can make it difficult for {{CHILD-NAME}} to hear information being presented verbally. Therefore, background noise should be minimized as much as possible when {{CHILD-NAME}} is expected to listen to instructions or information.
    12. Use of Technology: Below are examples of technology that can be used, if and when appropriate, to allow {{CHILD-NAME}} better access to instruction:
        - FM System: {{CHILD-NAME}} may benefit from the use of an FM system where his/her teachers wear a microphone or transmitter and {{CHILD-NAME}} wears a receiver that amplifies the sound. 
        - Video Captions: Real-time captioning should be used on videos shown in the classroom. 
    13. Use of Repetition: Teachers should repeat questions and comments made by other students or providers in the room before responding to ensure {{CHILD-NAME}} knows what information the teacher is responding to. 

# IEP Related Services 

## School-based Counseling

1. **School Counseling:** {{CHILD-NAME}} should receive continued school-based counseling services, on an individual basis. Topics to be addressed should include improving stress tolerance, developing concrete and easily accessible coping strategies, relating to others, and increasing independence with regard to decision-making and problem-solving. Additionally, he/she should be provided with additional opportunities for socialization (e.g., structured outings with same-age peers) in order to help develop his/her social repertoire. He/she can also be taught, and subsequently be encouraged to practice, the following activities: deep breathing, mindfulness activities, deep pressure (hand massaging, joint compression), tactile activities (squeezing a ball). Other sensory experiences that may be soothing to {{CHILD-NAME}} may be explored.    

## Executive Function Coaching

**Executive Functioning Coaching:** Coaches teach students how to organize, plan, prioritize, manage time, maintain focus, self-assess, and study efficiently. When working with teenagers or adults, coaches use real-life demands to show individuals ways to be more effective and productive. Unlike tutors, they don’t work on specific school subjects rather they teach how to become more efficient learners.  

## Change in IEP Classification

**Change in IEP Classification:** {{CHILD-NAME}}’s IEP classification should be updated from ‘Learning Disability’ to ‘Other Health Impaired,’ to better reflect his/her current diagnoses and primary areas of need.  

## Para

**Para-Professional Support:** Due to {{CHILD-NAME}}’s severe hyperactivity as well as difficulty coping with frustration and emotional outbursts, it is recommended that he/she be assigned a one-to-one para in the classroom who can help manage his/her behavior during emotional outbursts. The para can also assist in redirecting {{CHILD-NAME}} when he/she becomes distracted and provide support for managing his/her behavior.  

## Initiate IEP 

**Individualized Education Program (IEP):** {{CHILD-NAME}} requires educational services and supports in his/her school environment targeting his/her specific learning and emotional difficulty. {{CHILD-NAME}}’s parent should request a meeting with the Committee on Special Education (CSE) with the purpose of providing an IEP for {{CHILD-NAME}}.  The purpose of this meeting will be to determine an appropriate program that will meet {{CHILD-NAME}}’s educational needs and allow him/her to benefit from instruction. It will be important to consider specific learning and behavioral components of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s educational programming on an ongoing basis to ensure success. This will include periodic re-assessments to determine the outcome of interventions and adjust as necessary. 

## Extended School Year 

**Extended School Year:** Children such as {{CHILD-NAME}}, with developmental delays, are at higher risk for regression during summer months. As such {{CHILD-NAME}} should be provided with a 12-month extended school year, in order to prevent significant regression. 

# Visual Impairment Accommodations 

## Presentation Style

- **Large Print:** Large-print books are used for instruction or portions of books, such as a map, are enlarged as needed. 
- **Highlighting:** Markers and highlighting tape are used to enhance the important parts of text. 

# Further Evaluations 

## Writing evaluation 

**Supplemental Writing Evaluation:** The current evaluation did not comprehensively assess {{CHILD-NAME}}’s writing skills. Due to reported concerns regarding his/her written expression, further evaluation is recommended to assess his/her handwriting fluency, spelling, compositional fluency, writing mechanics, and composition: both narrative and expository. It is recommended that he/she be provided with additional services through an Individualized Education Program (IEP) if warranted.

## Assistive Technology 

**Assistive Technology:** Due to {{CHILD-NAME}}’s noted academic/ fine motor weaknesses, impacting his/her ability to independently access the general education curriculum, it is recommended he/she receive an Assistive Technology Evaluation in order to determine whether the use of assistive technology within the school setting is an appropriate and necessary support for him/her at this time. According to the most recent research, assistive technology is an effective support for students within the classroom and larger school settings for students with a myriad of weaknesses that impact their school functioning and ability to independently access curriculum. The appropriate assistive devices may help {{CHILD-NAME}} work more quickly and accurately, increase his/her confidence and independence, and help him/her meet his/her educational goals.  

## OT 

**Occupational Therapy Evaluation and Services:** Fine motor control is necessary for performing many hand-based tasks. Based on test results/parental concern regarding fine motor skills and observed difficulty with handwriting, it is recommended that {{CHILD-NAME}} receive an evaluation from an occupational therapist for implementation of occupational therapy if warranted. It is recommended that you request this evaluation at {{CHILD-NAME}}’s school placement, so that his/her IEP may be adjusted. 

## PT/OT 

1. **Physical and Occupational Therapy Evaluations:** A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation performed by a physical therapist and/or occupational therapist is recommended to address {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reported gross motor difficulties (i.e., poor balance, not well coordinated) as well as his/her endorsed sensory sensitivities (i.e., water, lotion, clothing). Diagnoses and recommendations for home- and school-based interventions are made based on direct observation and interaction, interviews, and available records. 
2. **Occupational Therapy:** Based on {{CHILD-NAME}}’s reported sensory-seeking behavior and {{PARENT-NAME}}’s concerns about his/her handwriting, it is recommended that he/she receive an evaluation for occupational therapy (OT). It is possible that some of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s impulsive and hyperactive behaviors are related to sensory vulnerabilities, and with proper OT interventions, these behaviors may decrease. 

## Re-Eval 

**Re-Evaluation:** {{CHILD-NAME}} should be re-evaluated in approximately 2-3 years to evaluate his/her progress in light of these supports, as well as to make new recommendations for appropriate educational and treatment interventions. 

# Speech and Language Eval 

**Speech and Language Evaluation and Services:** In light of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s inconsistent performance in language screening, a comprehensive evaluation of his/her language processing is recommended. This assessment should be performed by a certified speech-language pathologist. It is critical that this thorough evaluation aim to identify {{CHILD-NAME}}’s complete speech and language profile, including his/her pragmatic language skills. It is recommended that he/she be provided with additional services through an Individualized Education Program (IEP) if warranted.  

## Speech and Language Eval due low GFTA only 

**Speech and Language Evaluation and Services:** In light of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s performance on the GFTA-3 Sounds-in-Words subtest, similar clinician observations of articulation difficulties and reduced intelligibility, a comprehensive evaluation conducted by a certified speech-language pathologist is recommended. It is critical that this thorough evaluation aim to identify {{CHILD-NAME}}’s specific speech sound errors, and, if warranted, outline targeted goals to remediate those errors and improve intelligibility. It is recommended that he/she be provided with these additional services through his/her Individualized Education Program (IEP).  

## Bilingual Psychoed Eval 

### Spanish, suggested WMSL-R

**Bilingual Psychoeducational Evaluation:** Given {{CHILD-NAME}}’s history of language delays, exposure to dual-language settings, and difficulty understanding verbal instructions during the current evaluation, these test results are considered invalid. It will therefore be critical that he/she complete a more specialized evaluation, particularly one that considers the impact of his/her exposure to bilingual settings. Specifically, {{CHILD-NAME}} will need to complete an evaluation that first determines his/her language proficiency across conversational, formal, and academic domains. Typically, English-Spanish language proficiency evaluations include standardized measures that assess various aspects of verbal language ability, such as the Bilingual Verbal Abilities Test (BVAT) and the Woodcock -Muñoz Language Survey -Revised (WMSL-R). The BVAT tasks are first administered in one language, and then select items are re-administered in the examinee’s native language. Results are described in two clusters: English Language Proficiency (ELP) and Bilingual Verbal Ability (BVA). The ELP describes an individual’s receptive and expressive oral language development for English language use. The BVA describes an individual’s combined English and Spanish receptive and expressive language skills. The WMSL-R assesses an individual’s bilingual proficiency for oral/expressive language and receptive language/language comprehension. More specifically, the WMSL-R measures various aspects of an individual’s speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills in both English and Spanish. Typically, language proficiency evaluations are provided by neuropsychologists who are bilingual and have specialized professional training in conducting bilingual evaluations. Based on the results of the language proficiency evaluations, the evaluating neuropsychologist would design an individualized neuropsychological assessment battery that is tailored to {{CHILD-NAME}}’s English-Spanish language proficiency. Finally, the results of this comprehensive evaluation would be used to determine appropriate school placement, classroom setting, needed interventions, and accommodations.

Finally, the results of this comprehensive evaluation would be used to determine appropriate school placement, classroom setting, needed interventions, and accommodations. 

## Bilingual Speech Eval 

**Speech Language Evaluation:** In light of concern regarding longstanding difficulties in multiple aspects of receptive and expressive language, a comprehensive evaluation of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s language processing is recommended. This assessment should be performed by a certified bilingual speech-language pathologist, who can detail {{CHILD-NAME}}’s speech and language profile, using culturally and linguistically sensitive assessment methods, in order to differentiate between linguistic differences resulting from learning a second language vs. a language disorder.  

# School Refusal and Separation Anxiety 

## Supports for School Refusal 

The following are steps recommended by the National Association of School Psychologists to help support students and families dealing with school refusal:  
1. **Reentry plan:** A plan that addresses what steps will be taken when the student refuses to come to school should be developed in collaboration with the school. Forced school attendance may be appropriate for younger students or those with mild school refusal. A gradual reentry plan is often recommended for older students or students who are extremely anxious or depressed. Gradual reentry may start with having the student arrive at school but not go inside on day one, enter and visit in the front office on day two, and identify which class is most comfortable and stay just for that class on day three. The student should be helped to identify the staff members with whom he or she feels safest and who can greet the student and provide a safe harbor. For older students or those with significant anxiety or depression, allowing for progressive reentry over a 1–2 week period may be effective. Teams might also consider part-time schooling, or they might temporarily allow a flexible school day for students with extended absences (e.g., over 2 years) due to extreme levels of anxiety and depression and when other interventions have been unsuccessful. 
2. **Regular Routines:** Parents should try to set up regular evening and morning routines, reinforce their child’s positive behaviors (participation efforts), and ignore negative behaviors (crying, whining).  
3. **Collaboration:** Assist parents in bringing a reluctant or acting-out child into the school. Work with parents to effectively respond to their child’s complaints about school, while clearly ensuring that the child attends school.  
4. **Monitor Attendance:** Work with parents to monitor attendance, particularly for older students.  
5. **Morning Greeting:** Welcome the separation-anxious child when he or she arrives at school. Help the child become involved in getting organized for the day. Give the child special jobs, such as handing out papers or collecting books. Praise and encourage the child and provide comfort to younger students when they are upset. 
6. **Reward System:** Set up rewards for school attendance.  
7. **Peer Buddy:** Assign a peer buddy at recess or lunch to help a socially anxious child feel more comfortable. Some schools issue personal invitations to events and activities to help students feel welcome.  
8. **School-Based Mental Health Support:** Provide a safe harbor with the counselor, nurse, or school psychologist where the student can go when feeling stressed or overwhelmed.  

## Supports for Promoting School Attendance in Children with Separation Anxiety 

Children who have difficulty separating from their caregivers to attend school can benefit from the following strategies;
1. **Reentry plan:** A plan that addresses what steps will be taken when the student’s anxiety interferes with their willingness to attend class should be developed in collaboration with the school. A gradual reentry plan is often recommended for older students or students who are extremely anxious. Gradual reentry may start with having the student arrive at school but not go inside on day one, enter and visit in the front office on day two, and identify which class is most comfortable and stay just for that class on day three. The student should be helped to identify the staff members with whom he or she feels safest and who can greet the student and provide a safe harbor. For older students or those with significant anxiety or depression, allowing for progressive reentry over a 1–2 week period may be effective. Teams might also consider part-time schooling, or they might temporarily allow a flexible school day for students with extended absences (e.g., over 2 years) due to extreme levels of anxiety and when other interventions have been unsuccessful. 
2. **Regular Routines** Parents should try to set up regular evening and morning routines, reinforce their child’s positive behaviors (participation efforts), and ignore negative behaviors (crying, whining). 
3. **Collaboration:** Assist parents in bringing a reluctant or acting-out child into the school. Work with parents to effectively respond to their child’s complaints about school, while clearly ensuring that the child attends school. 
4. **Morning Greeting:** Welcome the separation-anxious child when he or she arrives at school. Help the child become involved in getting organized for the day.

It is critical that this thorough evaluation aim to identify {{CHILD-NAME}}’s complete speech and language profile, including his/her pragmatic language skills. It is recommended that he/she be provided with additional services through his/her school/university/college’s office disability services.  

### Academics and Learning - Executive Functioning

1. **School Consultation:** It is recommended that a consultation is requested in {{CHILD-NAME}}’s school/university/college in order to share the results of this evaluation. It is important that {{CHILD-NAME}}’s professors understand his/her learning profile and that he/she continues to receive(s) educational services and supports in his/her school environment to target executive functioning difficulties in a formalized support plan. It will be important to consider specific behavioral components of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s educational programming on an ongoing basis to ensure success.  
2. **Executive Functioning Coaching:** Coaches teach students how to organize, plan, prioritize, manage time, maintain focus, self-assess, and study efficiently. When working with teenagers or adults, coaches use real-life demands to show individuals ways to be more effective and productive. Unlike tutors, they don’t work on specific school subjects rather they teach how to become more efficient learners.  
3. **Academic Support:** {{CHILD-NAME}}’s instructional needs must be addressed immediately to ensure that he/she does not quit trying and that he/she progresses academically. Due to {{CHILD-NAME}}’s significant learning weaknesses, he/she requires intervention to remediate his/her deficits in decoding, fluency, reading comprehension, and phonological processing. Examples of adult literacy reading programs are listed below: 
    1. *Orton-Gillingham method*, which is a multi-modal, research-based reading remediation program that targets reading instruction through visual (learning graphic symbols), auditory (discriminating among sounds), and kinesthetic (learning motor patterns for writing symbols) modalities.

# Assistive Technology - SLD-R

Students who struggle with reading, including those identified to have a Specific Learning Disorder, benefit significantly from the use of assistive technology (AT).  
1. **Text-to-speech (TTS) Apps:** These allow students to see text and hear it aloud at the same time. To use these tools, students click on a highlighted word(s), and the words are read aloud by a computer-generated voice. TTS may be used with any digital text (i.e., books, emails, web pages), and can be used to convert text files to audio files. Low cost apps are available for download on tablets and smartphones, such as: 
    1. *Voice Dream Reader* is a customizable app that allows one to highlight text and have it read aloud to them. Users can adjust the voice the app uses as well as its speed, and connect to their Google Drive, Evernote, or Dropbox accounts to have documents read to them. 
    2. *Claro ScanPen* allows you to take a photo of printed text, select the text with your finger, and have it read aloud, including worksheets and school notices. This app utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and therefore does not require an internet connection to work.  
    3. *Dyslexia Toolbox* markets itself as an app “by dyslexic people for dyslexic people” and offers a suite of useful AT features are available for older kids and adolescents with dyslexia. Features include a type pad with word prediction software that can help users create messages for text, email, and social media, as well as a digital overlay for reading text through a color screen and a digital photo reader (for purchase) that takes photos of text and reads them aloud. Price: Free; some features require in-app purchase.  
    4. *Read&Write for Google Chrome* is an extension that can be purchased for a $100 yearly subscription but is free for teachers to set up accounts for their students. Its TTS software offers several voices and dual-color highlighting, which highlights both sentence and individual words as their read aloud and can read text from screenshots and images. This extension offers a text and picture dictionary to aide in reading comprehension as well as the ability to simplify the text on the page (i.e., collects the most important information and creates a summary).  
    5. *Snap&Read Universal* is a TTS tool that starts reading a webpage aloud from where one clicks on a word. It has the ability to read both digital text as well as text in pictures and images. This extension also features the ability to simplify words and phrases for readers who struggle with vocabulary. Students may also highlight and organize text into an outline to help with reading comprehension.  
    6. *SpeakIt* is a simple TTS tool in which readers highlights text in Chrome, click a button, and listen as the words are read aloud. Users can adjust the speaking pace and select from several voices.  
    7. *Scrible* assists with reading and researching online with set of note-taking tools that allows readers to mark up and save information from web pages. A pop-up tool bar offers the ability to highlight text in several colors, add sticky notes, underline, bold, strikethrough, and italicize text, as well as bookmark and save annotated pages. Price: $28/year, basic version is free. 
    8. *Read Mode* is a free extension for Google Chrome that removes clutter from web pages to make them easier to read by eliminating ads and animations and converting web pages into simple black and white text articles. 
2. **Literacy Software Programs:** These programs for laptop or desktop computers have been proven effective in assisting struggling readers and while costlier, often offer more functions than their app counterparts. Examples include;  
    1. *ClaroRead* offers TTS and OCR capabilities which allows users to have text and images read to them, as well as screen masking, which hides part of the screen in order to reduce distractions, as well as talking and pronunciation dictionaries.  Price: $225 (Windows)/$260 (Mac), the Basic version is available for $85, but only offers TTS and OCR. 
    2. *Inspiration* allows readers to create graphic organizers to help them understand what they’re reading, as well as reading templates to help readers identify story elements and characters or to compare and contrast ideas. Price: $39.95 (Mac or Windows). 
    3. *Microsoft Immersive Reader* is a tool that can be used for free in Microsoft Word, OneNote, Outlook, and the Edge browser. Features include TTS, OCR, and screen masking, as well as display control, which allows users to control how documents are viewed, including spacing, fonts, margins, and color of the text and background. A picture dictionary function shows a picture of what a word means along with its written definition. The Immersive Reader can also divide words into syllables, which can help with decoding, and words can also be labeled according to parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). 
    4. *NaturalReader* offers TTS capabilities that allows users to listen to webpages and various documents with the choice of several different natural-sounding readers, as well as OCR for up to 30 documents in the free version. The program syncs with an app for use on mobile devices. Price: $99.50 (Mac or Windows), there is a Basic version available for free. 
3. **Audiobooks and Digital TTS Books** allow students to hear books read aloud. Audiobooks have the added benefit of having a human reader, which is often preferable to the computer-generated voice in TTS books.  
    1. Apps and websites such as *Audible* (www.audible) and *Epic!* (www.getepic.com) offer extensive libraries of audiobooks for most reading levels. If your child’s school subscribes to Epic! They can be set up with an individual account with their teacher in order to provide them with free access to the library. 
    2. *Learning Ally* (https://learningally.org/) is an audiobook reader that offers access to over 80,000 audiobooks with real voice readers. To use this app, you must have a Learning Ally membership ($135/year for unlimited books). However, if your child’s school subscribes to Learning Ally, they can be provided with an account at no cost. 
    3. *Bookshare:* Many schools subscribe to Bookshare (www.bookshare.org), which would permit your child access. Additionally, those with documented diagnoses of Dyslexia or another “print disability” may quality for a free Bookshare account independently.

# Winston Prep Students (language taken from Susan Luger Associates) 

**Academic Interventions:** Due to {{CHILD-NAME}}’s Specific Learning Disorder, he/she requires ongoing intense skills remediation with a skills-based curriculum to remediate his/her deficits in encoding, decoding fluency, reading comprehension, and phonological processing. Given the constellation of strengths and difficulties with which {{CHILD-NAME}} presents, he/she requires the provision of intervention in a small, structured special education school where teachers are trained to address the needs of students with similar profiles. Reading instruction should include research-based practices that support each of his/her areas of need, such as Orton Gillingham, Read Naturally, and LindaMood-Bell. Ongoing assessments of {{CHILD-NAME}}’s program (e.g., biweekly) are necessary to ensure that his/her individual curriculum is developed, adjusted, and refined based on his/her progress. Examples of evidence-based instruction are provided below. 
1. **Phonological Processing/Decoding:**
    - Because {{CHILD-NAME}} has not mastered the underlying decoding skills to read non-familiar words, a systematic phonics intervention is needed. A program such as *Lindamood-Bell* LIPS (https://lindamoodbell.com/program/lindamood-phoneme-sequencing-program), which teaches the awareness of sounds using a multisensory approach, would be appropriate. Initially, students learn the lip, tone, and mouth actions required to produce certain sounds. After students learn these skills, activities focus on sequencing, reading, and spelling the oral aspects of sounds to identify and order sounds in words. Direct instruction in letter patterns, sight words, and using context cues in reading is provided. 
    - Teach {{CHILD-NAME}} how to use structural analysis to decode multisyllabic words. Ensure that he/she “over learns” these skills so that he/she begins to see unfamiliar words as a sequence of recognizable word parts. Teach him/her to identify both meaningful parts (prefixes, suffixes, and root words) and pronunciation parts (common clusters and syllables). 
    - Teach structural analysis by cutting apart words into common clusters. Keep the letters of the words you are working with large. Combine the word parts in a variety of ways to make pseudowords or real words to pronounce. Let him/her then scramble the letters to make new words for you to pronounce. 
    - When pronouncing multisyllabic words, have {{CHILD-NAME}} slide his/her index finger slowly under the word parts as she pronounces them. 
2. **Foundational Reading:** Given his/her cognitive profile and poorly developed decoding and fluency skills, {{CHILD-NAME}} requires the immediate provision of a multi-sensory intervention that supports the development of his/her verbal working memory and focuses on intensive drilling in phonics, such as *Orton Gillingham*.  
3. **Reading Fluency:** Given his/her cognitive profile and poorly developed decoding and fluency skills, {{CHILD-NAME}} requires the immediate provision of an intervention that focuses on the development of his/her reading fluency skills, such as *Read Naturally*. 
4. **Reading and Writing:** The *Lindamood Bell Seeing Stars®* program (https://lindamoodbell.com/program/seeing-stars-program) is a multi-modal, Orton-Gillingham-based approach to reading and writing intervention that encompasses these three modalities. This program focuses on word attack, word recognition, spelling, and paragraph reading by improving symbol imagery skills and increasing dual-coding ability (the integration of imagery and language).

**Specific Accommodations for those with Nonverbal and Visual Spatial Weaknesses:**
1. **Class Routines and Schedules:** {{CHILD-NAME}}’s classroom should have daily class routines and the schedule on the board. 
2. **Verbal Cues Before Transitions:** {{CHILD-NAME}} should be provided with several verbal cues from teachers before transitions.  
3. **Adjustment Time:** Give {{CHILD-NAME}} time to preview and prepare for new activities like group projects, changes in routine, and field trips.  
4. **Review:** Review previous information before presenting new ideas. 
5. **Break Down Ideas and Projects:** Break down abstract concepts and encourage {{CHILD-NAME}} to ask for information to be explained again. Break a big project into smaller steps. Make sure {{CHILD-NAME}} understands the overall goal and how the various parts fit together. 
6. **Provide a Lesson Overview:** Give an overview of a lesson before teaching it. Clearly state the objective of the lesson; priming {{CHILD-NAME}} in this way will help him/her get ready to learn. 
7. **Reading Comprehension Assignments:** For more complex reading material, write notes in the margin to help him/her focus in on certain points or ask {{CHILD-NAME}} to read the text again and pick out the details. 
8. **Directions:** Provide written directions and speak slowly when giving directions. It may be difficult for {{CHILD-NAME}} to also generalize from directions given in the past; therefore, repeat them as necessary.  
9. **Self-talk:** {{CHILD-NAME}} will benefit from teaching approaches that promote the development of self-talk. Reveal and discuss inner thoughts that aid in comprehension. Help him/her learn to ask and answer questions as an aid to evaluating and monitoring comprehension.  
10. **Decision Making Skills:** Use the following five-step method to help {{CHILD-NAME}} learn to improve decision making skills: (a) define the issue (e.g., no lunch money for school); (b) verbalize available options (e.g., call home, borrow money, skip lunch, share another’s lunch); (c) identify the best option; (d) take that action;  and (e) review action and decide if the plan was effective.

# Remote Learning 

**Remote Learning Adaptations to Accommodations:** The following adaptations and supports should be considered for {{CHILD-NAME}} during remote learning; 
1. **Processing Speed and Executive Functioning Accommodations:**
    - Emailed copies of notes from the teacher’s lesson 
    - Allow {{CHILD-NAME}} to record the lessons or have the teacher provide recorded lessons 
    - Voice-to-text technology to assist with writing or typing 
    - Questions provided ahead of calls so {{CHILD-NAME}} can prepare their answers 
    - Detailed lists of instructions for assignments 
    - Additional time to turn in assignments 
    - Adjust the amount screen time 
2. **School-Counseling:** {{CHILD-NAME}} needs additional support, due to social-emotional stress secondary to the pandemic. Therefore, supportive counseling services are recommended to bolster coping strategies.  
3. **Reduce workload:** {{CHILD-NAME}}’s current workload is contributing to emotional distress. Therefore accommodations should be made to reduce their workload. Some examples are as follows;    
    - {{CHILD-NAME}} can answer every other math problem, completing only the first page of an assignment or writing one essay instead of three.
    - Modifying the content so, for example, they only choose between two multiple choice answers instead of four 
    - Decrease the level of difficulty for an assignment or in a certain subject if they’re struggling to understand the concept or are below grade level. 
    - Assign alternative projects or presentations that still allow {{CHILD-NAME}} to demonstrate an understanding of the material. This could mean they create a video or draw a comic strip instead of writing a paper, produce a multimedia poster instead of giving a presentation or even have a one-to-one conversation with the teacher where they engage in a conversation about the topic. 
4. **Manage Screen Time:** {{CHILD-NAME}} is struggling with the amount of time he/she is required to spend looking at a screen during remote learning.  
    - {{CHILD-NAME}} should be allowed to join the lessons for the amount of time they can manage and slowly build up to more time, minute by minute, until they can fully participate in the lessons and discussions.  
    - Try adjusting the settings so {{CHILD-NAME}} can only see the teacher, or ask if {{CHILD-NAME}} can turn their camera off so they feel more comfortable. 
    - Request printable versions of worksheets via email or ask that they be mailed to your home. Once the work is complete, take pictures of each page and email them to the teacher. Alternatively, request that {{CHILD-NAME}} speak and record their answers and then email them to the teacher.
